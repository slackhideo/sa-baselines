"2","Expensive and Delicious. If I'm shelling out a lot of money I expect the service and quality that goes along with it. And man, was that a damn good breakfast. Chicken and Waffles were amazing, Truffle Parmesan Fries were heavenly.\n\nThis was my first time at The Wynn, and the first time I actually enjoyed Vegas! Everything is made in house, and you can tell. I absolutely recommend everything about this restaurant, including the hotel it is in!"
"1","I had an appointment with her, and less than an hour of my appointment, she calls me and cancels. She said that it was a family issue, which I could understand. The bad part about it was that she didn't even apologize! It's been over two weeks now, and I heard nothing from her. With customer service like that, you might as well kiss your business goodbye sooner or later if you treat people like that!"
"1","We stayed here 11 years ago for our daughters 21st.  It was great.  What happened?  Now, it is dirty,drab and depressing.  We were promised a suite at a high level and got a room with a view of a wall on the 3rd floor.  As far as we are concerned, they went from 5 stars to 0.  No amenities, towels you do not want to use, and don't sit on the furniture-- it is scary."
"2","Where I come from, while having a shabu shabu you might as well drop your wallet into the pot so expensive is the experience.\n\nHanashima hits the spot on all fronts. \n\nFirstly, it is a very informal setting and elegantly minimalistic. High stools, a long counter and an individual burner for each guest are really all it takes for shabu shabu, no bells and whistles added.\n\nSecondly, it is incredibly well-priced and they make a perceptible effort to keep their prices down. In the two and more years I've been a patron, the prices haven't changed by a digit.\n\nRecession bit them too, so today instead of ice cream PLUS iced coffee for dessert, you get one or the other. Additionally, if before prices included tax, today the tax is extra. It is still a bargain.\n\nThirdly, the service is efficient, polite, cheerful and fast. I would go to Hanashima just to have the waitress smile at me.\n\nFourthly, the menu is simple but the meal is filling and involves a variety of courses. The extra sides you can order make the customisations almost endless.\n\nEven ethnic food sceptics appreciate the straightforwardness of Hanashima's approach and the sheer quality of their food. I've seen it happen first-hand.\n\nOther reviewers mentioned another website that lists Hanashima (restomontreal). After reading the reviews on Yelp, heading over there for the vouchers can actually offset the sales taxes (10%). (I hope this doesn't breach Yelp's terms).\n\nHanashima is a spot to keep in your books due to its perfection and its location. In the heart of Chinatown, it is close to great Chinese bakeries where you can get an extra dessert and bubble tea.\n\nI also recommend Hanashima for a cheap and no-strings-attached date, or for post-important-introductions dinners. The counter seating doesn't require guests to stare at each other for the meal's duration, the crowd, decor and food provide great converation starters and the gentle broth's bubbling fills in the necessary moments of silence.\n\nA relaxed meal in an unusual setting without the pressure of it being too unusual. Vegetarians are catered for with the huge veggie combo, meat-eaters are spoilt for choice, seafood lovers will delight in the seafood combo and everyone will have a great time at an excellent price.\n\nGet the regular portions, splurge because here you can!\n\nReserve whenever you go: I saw it fill up pretty fast on both weekday (sometimes) and weekend nights (always)."
"1","Wish I could give negative stars.\n\nCalled ahead to verify they were open for business, was told that \""everything was warming up\"", but yes, they were open.\n\nArrived at 9:36, left at 10:01.\n\nMy g/f waited at least five minutes to be seated, while I went to use the restroom.\n\nAlso, your waitress took my g/f's order and brought drinks, but never came back to the table after I came out of the restroom. And my g/f said the waitress wasn't even in her uniform yet, and changed after she took the order.\n\nNever received the appetizer, never had my order taken.\n\nSeriously, get some softer fucking toilet paper and paper towels. That's a really chickenshit way to make more profit."
"2","I have used Gloria's Blossoms for many corporate events where balloon bouquets where ordered.  On each order, I have received exceptional customer service which was often above the norm. The manager is very personable and flexible in scheduling set up and delivery.  I recommend this service and will utilize them again in the future."
"1","A couple years ago, my BF treated me to a massage at Massage Envy, she had a coupon for a discount.  When we booked the appointment, I requested a female masseuse.  When we arrived, I was told I would have a male masseuse instead.  I take daily injections for a medical condition, and I happen to bruise very easily.  Prior to the massage, I had hit a vein and caused a dark bruise on my stomach.  I warned the masseuse about the bruise, but English was apparently not his first language.  When I flipped over, the masseuse saw the bruise and asked if my husband was abusive.  I then had to re-explain the bruise a couple of times before he understood.  Also, the masseuse was quite chatty which I don't care for at all.  Needless to say, this was not a relaxing massage at all, I would rate it as my all time worst massage."
"2","Ok. Let's just be serious for a moment. When you're home, and it's too hot to cook and you've worked all day...what about this crab puff craving you have? You call this place, like right now. It's so delicious for a empty not-so-busy place. Everything is so good, and delivery is ridiculous fast. You can easily find the menu online, sort of like all the other places out there, but their food is hot and delicious. If you ask for sauce on the side, everything is crunchy and amazing. Do it, and get the crab puffs. You know you want to!"
"2","I am a fairly loyal Harris Teeter shopper, but have rarely gone to this location, as I have several closer to me.  Finding myself near this Teeter today after a lunch at Libretto's (across the parking lot), I stopped in for a few items that were on sale. \n\nLocated at the Corner of Johnston/521 and Ballantyne Commons Pkwy, this is a large Harris Teeter without being HUGE.  Parking is ample for the grocery store and the surrounding stores.\n\nAs of this writing, in June of 2013, they are currently doing a remodel and are down to 1 set of doors at one end of the store.  The current layout of the store is the typical Teet floor plan, but the signage is a little more updated.  Aisles were well marked, VIC savings were plainly marked on the items I was looking for.  For a late Sunday afternoon, there were plenty of registers open.  The woman who checked me out was very pleasant and I was quickly on my way.\n\nClean store (even with the remodeling going on) in an easily accessed location."
"2","What a great date spot! So romantic....I could see the Match.com love in the air.....  I have been here over the years several times (no not for Match!), and again last night due to a citipass bogo coupon. It is much better than I remembered!  My friend and I shared the chicken and andouille sausage soup which was DIVINE ($4). I had the chicken marsala and my friend had the seafood risotto. The marsala was probably enough for two people - it was a huge plate of fettuccine with two grilled chicken breasts and a ton of mushrooms. Thank god they are smart enough to do fresh (not canned) mushrooms. So perfect. \n\nThe seafood risotto was very good- it came with 6 mussels plopped on top which were lightly seasoned. My friend said some of the scallops in the risotto were a tiny bit tough but overall it was excellent. Entrees were about 13 bucks a piece, very worth the price! I will definitely be back!!! :-D"
"1","First of all, let me say that they would have gotten 3 stars, but I took one star off for price.\n\nWe came in famished and buzzed around 12 AM.  Lousy 6 hour drive to vegas thanks to traffic.\n\nOur server appeared kinda slow.  At first I thought he was stoned because he spoke slowly and incoherently but he was okay for the most part...just a little slow with the check/he didn't stop by our table very often.  \n\nFood.  We started off with the buffalo wings, which I thought were okay.  Some were a bit small.\n\nI asked for the Hawaiian rib eye, and he said they were out.  in fact they were out of all steak except for the filet mignion.  wtf?  i like my steak w/ a bit of chew, and yea i know rib eye is a bit soft too, but i was tempted by the hawaiian part.  instead i opted for the Jamaican jerk pork chops.  very large side of steamed vegetables.  baked potato (hard to mess that up).  pork chops said they were marinated, but sure as hell didn't taste like it.  more like the grill with a bit of spices sprinkled on.  still it was cooked well, and wasn't dry.  two small but fat pieces of chops.\ni thought it was mediocre food at a high price (20 bucks for the chops).  it'd be better to go some place else, but i was staying here, and that was the only place open at the time.  \n\nbut i was buzzed and hungry so i ate it all up.  their fries were good.\nhad the 10% off coupon i got when i checked in.\n\nall in all, if you don't want to read what i wrote: overpriced mediocre food.  go eat at somewhere cheaper, and then play what you saved at a blackjack table.  21!\n\nopen 24 hours, like most casino cafes"
"2","My 2nd visit proved to live up to my 1st. Truly unparalleled hospitality from each crew member from the hostesses, each staff member as you walk to your table & the waiter. A real Welcome To My Home, Let Me show You Around & Feed You My Best Dishes experience. \nAmong all the antipasti platter choices my favorite is Giada's. Although I think I might ask to sub the pesto crostini for something else. Among the pasta selections the Lobster Ravioli is still my favorite but now I'll also add the Bucatini to that list. \nFor dessert the Polenta Cake, Strawberry Tart & Chocolate Chip cookie were worth the calories. \nTomorrow I will give the new lunch service a try....... Safe to say I won't be weighing myself this week"
"2","So brunch buffets are as synonymous with Las Vegas as Lebron is to basketball, and there is a whole lot of winning going on at the Sterling Brunch in the Bally's Hotel and Casino. Tucked in the back of the ground floor of Bally's in the BLT Steak restaurant rests one of the newest, and I will say it, finest brunch buffets in Las Vegas.\n\nNow it isn't called the \""Sterling\"" Brunch for no reason, it costs, it costs big time.\n\nMost of us are not willing to pay $90 per person for brunch, but because of the high quality of seafood, meats and champagne that they serve, I must admit, the price tag is justified. I usually avoid buffets in general as quantity is NOT what gets me hard, it's the quality, and the Sterling Brunch has both.\n\nWhen you are seated you are immediately served two Gruyere popovers. For those of you who are new to popovers, as I was, they are an American version of English Yorkshire pudding. They are baked custard in muffin tins, but the inside is not dense, it is very light and moist. It was pretty insane. It was as if the crispy shell was basted for hours with liquefied cheese as the flavor of the Gruyere was wonderfully powerful. Slather some sea-salted butter on the inside and you are ready to party.\n\nAs a start for brunch, or any meal for that matter, it doesn't get better than this.\n\nNext up was the buffet. On my first round I focused solely on seafood, the options were far and wide in this category alone. Baked lobster tail, King crab legs, crab claws, jumbo shrimp, oysters, and crab cakes.\n\nUm, yes.\n\nOut of all of them I recommend the baked lobster tail and the King crab legs the most, the quality of them were excellent and the flavors were good and rich. Skip the crab cake. It will take up too much valuable real estate; not to mention it kinda blows.\n\nNow the offering of caviar is one of the major reasons this brunch stands out. That, and the unlimited Perrier-Jouet Grand Brut champagne (a $50/bottle value). Though the caviar is American Amia (bowfin roe from Louisiana), which, though quiet common and inexpensive, is still a buffet rarity and presented with blinis, cr\u00e8me fraiche, capers and finely diced red onion so you feel, well, spoiled. Regardless.\n\nEgg me, baby.\n\nThe caviar is just one of the many items offered on their menu outside of the buffet options. We ordered the Caesar salad, tuna tartar, the lobster eggs Benedict and the lobster bisque; the bisque was a bit more like a bouillabaisse but still yummy.\n\nNow, they also offer filet mignon, truffled mashed potatoes and creamed spinach as well as lamb chops so one can get their steakhouse on.\n\nI sampled them as a dessert substitute because, well, I've always been more of a salt guy than a sugar dude. But alas my stomach could hold no more, but if one were so inclined, and has a larger stomach muscle than my own, feel free to polish off those dishes as well because they are good times.\n\nAdeye took the trip down Dessert Ave.  It's one of the prettiest avenues I have seen and she seemed very pleased.\n\nSterling Brunch. You have raised the brunch bar so high we could barely get our legs and bellies over it. Congratulations for redefining the Vegas buffet for those of us who care about quality."
"2","I just returned from Vegas for a holiday girls' trip, and the Spa at MOLAS was one of our stops during our vacation.  My travel partner works concierge at the spa at Mandarin Oriental's DC location, so she was interested and checking out the facility even though neither of us could spare the cash to splurge on a treatment here.  This review is strictly for the facilities, which I simultaneously found both incredibly impressive and disappointing.  Disappointing only because the spa lacks some of my favorite standard spa amenities like a jacuzzi (they only had a warm \""vitality pool\"" which was at least 10 degrees cooler than how I would run my bath) and a sauna.  To me, use of the spa facilities are half the draw of visiting a spa even when I do book treatments so the lack of some of my favorite amenities was a bit of a bummer.  That aside, this spa has a lot going for it.  The spa areas were immaculately clean, attractively modern in their design, offered stellar views of the strip, and had a lot of cool techy features like experience showers with touch screen menus and the ability to turn on the jets for the vitality pool on a station/lounger by station/lounger basis rather than for the whole pool.  Their relation room is one of the nicest and most relaxing one I've ever been in, with plenty of beds situated in front of windows overlooking the strip to rest in while waiting for your appointment or just to get some rest.  Finally, I can't say enough good things about their staff.  The service was top notch, friendly and extremely attentive without being obtrusive.  Always there to offer you a towel, a bottle of water or to fetch eye makeup remover for when the experience showers have ruined your eyeliner and you've neglected to bring your own.  Really top notch service."
"2","Nella mia visita a Phoenix, i miei amici mi portano a cena al Village Tavern. Luci soffuse, arredi in legno tradizionali, ma un'ottima cucina. Ho assaggiato il filetto di manzo in salsa madera che \u00e8 stato una meraviglia! Carne tenerissima che si tagliava con la forchetta. Ottimo l'antipasto: un quarto d'insalata Iceberg con salsa al blue cheese (gorgonzola). Per concludere una buona fetta di cheesecake al limone.\nSe passate di qui, \u00e8 un ottimo posto per provare la moderna cucina Made in USA."
"2","Wonderful!\n\n  I love this place.  I would have never tried it on my own, but a friend introduced me to it and I have loved it ever since.  They have a cool decor and great food.  I recommend the Panang Curry and Pad See Ewe.  Both are delicious.  \n\n  They have weird hours with a gap during the afternoon and are closed one day a week I think, but definitely a place worth checking out.  You wont be disappointed."
"2","Having stayed here a few times now, let me give you a suggestion.  It seems to me that the best rooms to stay is are the ones on the higher floors.  The rooms are great! The views of the valley and The Strip are AMAZING, if you are on a high enough floor.  \n\nMy biggest complaint is that there really is no place to eat in the hotel.  There is a small walk through type of convenience store with a couple of outdoor patio style chairs and tables.   You can buy food like prepackaged cereal or oatmeal, muffins, yogurt - stuff like that. You can get coffee in the morning. However, forget late night snacks, it closes early. \nAfter the second time I stayed there, I heard you can go sit at the bar and order food that comes from the Aria, which is across the oddly designed entrance to the Vdara.  \n\nThere is a place that looks like it is a restaurant, decorated in '70 style colors and decor. However, it is never open. It always say closed for an event.  That's just the sign they use so you don't realize that the place just never opens."
"2","Fantastic,make reservations ahead of time books quick\nVery classy very traditional,one of my favorite dinning places in Vegas\nI recomend the Filet and the creamed corn,don't et full on the bread basket,the bacon muffins are addictive\n\n\nWell Done"
"1","Just got back from spending almost a week here after working the POOL Tradeshow. First of all we get there and the lines to check in are insane! I understand waiting in line is going to happen in summer but you would think they would open more then 3 lines to get the line moving..but they didn't. We finally get to the front and there was a problem with their credit card machine understandable but this lady didn't say anything not a thanks for waiting or a heads up about what was taking long.I already got the vibe that this hotel was going to suck balls. Luckily we weren't in the actually pyramid which I don't even know how people stay in those rooms with the casino RIGHT below them.\nWe got to our room and our bathroom smelled like the maid had double deckered our toliet ( this is when someone shits in the tank and leaves it there so it permantely smells like shit) we even checked to see if one was in there. It was horrible but knowing how shitty there service was we didn't even bother to call to change rooms. Next thing we notice our beds have blood spots on them not just one a HANDFUL visibly on top. I mean at least try to hide that shit. We called for them to change the sheets and they did thanksfully..(costing us 5 for the tip)\nWe had a friend staying with us so we called down for a roll away but once again we had to be inconvienced. They said we had to come down to give our credit card info.. what is this 1998? So our friend had to wait in the long ass line just to ask for a rollaway. The rollaway came 3 hours later. They said we wouldn't be charge, wow finally a break from the shittiness.When we were done with it the next day we called to get it picked up and NO ONE came. We decided to leave it in the hallway but then this ended up costing us a 100 dollars (not so free afterall). Thankfully they removed the charge or I would have gone ape shit.The last thing that really was a pain in the ass about this hotel is the parking. It was an absolute joke it was as if they built it last minute thinking \"" O wait we have to have somewhere for our guests to park\"", It is small, most of the time we were crossing our fingers for a spot. Also it is a journey to the casino and when it is hot as hell out that really pisses you off.They basically don't care here and have no hospitality for their guests. I get it your rooms are cheap but I mean if you want return customers you have to do your job and be nice to us. This hotel also had a weird vibe in it I really wouldn't doubt it being curse. The ONLY cool part about it is that it leads to Mandalay Bay but honestly I would rather drive then stay in this hotel again."
"1","Well, it's a Starbucks...  Same coffee, same general atmosphere, but that is all that's good about this location.  It is about a third the size it needs to be, there is ALWAYS a waiting line and tables are overcrowded and sometimes hard to find.  Forget meeting with any privacy at all.  I felt like I was in the middle of three other conversations!\n\nI DO NOT recommend this location!"
"2","Stumbled upon Zucca one night when walking over to the Traverse. At the time, the boy and I looked at the menu, looked at each other and promptly decided 'Valentines'. The menu had plenty options for meat, fish and vegetarian eaters alike, it was hard to pick really what I wanted to try first!\n\nFor Valentines itself, there was a set menu for 28 quid (3 courses). This little cafe/restaurant had their delivery down pat. Although clearly preprepared, the food was of such high quality you could forgive them for working round what is such a high turnover night for restaurants. The waiting staff (or at least the lady who served us) were discreet, and efficient, allowing us time between courses to pause but not to start to wander. \n\nTo the meal: as we sat down, my eye was immediately drawn to the table arrangement. Now, I don't normally comment, but on the table was a little tray of salt, pepper and oil with just the smallest dab of balsamic vinegar. It almost looked like a work of art in itself to match the flower arrangement and candle. \n\nAs it was Valentines day, I treated myself as the non driver of the night to a Valentines cocktail, a martini-based strawberry infused concoction, with (I swear) a hint of herb - basil? Might have imagined it, but it was a delicious aperitif to start the evening. I followed it up with a large glass of Nero D'Avolo, more of an acquired taste, which arrived the further I travelled down the glass. The boy tucked into a rose prosecco, which was like a trail of bubbly lava going down the throat. \n\nTo the food - for starters, I had roasted Mediterranean vegetables with rocket while the boy had wild mushroom tart. I think this was the only time I felt a pang of regret for the preparation style as the vegetables were refrigerator-cold, where I expected them to be even a little warm still. Nonetheless, great texture, great flavour, and the mushroom tart tasted lovely as well, although the pastry was a little hard for the boys taste (re-warmed, we suspected). \n\nWe also tucked into warm rosemary foccacia (oh, so, so rosemary good, I haven't eaten bread this delicious in a while) and olives while we waited for our starter and took the opportunity to mop up olive soaked oil as well as the balsamic-dipped oil that had so caught my eye earlier. \n\nAnyway, back to the main course, where I had a beautifully cooked piece of salmon, resting on top of a spring onion potato cake (you know that goosebump feeling you get when you tuck into slowly cooked, caramelised onions - well, this one would have had you at your knees) and sauteed spinach surrounded by a lake of creamy herb sauce. The boy had ribeye steak in a green peppercorn sauce that in his words, melted in the mouth and he had never had a steak cooked so well. My my, strong words, but I believed him. A side of garlic foccacia bread had us stuffed to the gunnels, but in such a satisfied way.\n\nFinally, we both had the passionfruit sorbet as a light finish to a sumptious meal. I was expecting something sweet, but this sorbet was sharp as they come and super, super cold, having also been pre-prepared (frozen strawberries at the bottom were a giveaway). Doused with prosecco, it was a welcome accompaniment to the sharp sorbet.\n\nSo in summary, Zucca, you are sharp as they come. Highly recommended and definitely glad we chose you for our meal last night."
"2","We loved this place since they were located next to the Smith's on Flamingo, small intimate, but then they expanded to their location on Spring Mountain, it was big and very nicely decorated but they closed up even though it always appeared to be busy, we thought they were gone for good, but then we discovered their newest location at Village square and are enjoying once again great food and service. \n\nI love the happy hour, who doesnt love margaritta's! They serve roasted onions and jalapena with radish, soup with the meal and they gave us complmentary desert. \n\nI chose the combination plate, chili relleno, beef taco and chili verde enchilada. It was very good. My husband got a steak it was grilled and very tender! It was a good meal. Always good food great service and good margaritta's!"
"1","Some of my favorite bands that come through town end up playing at the Clubhouse.  Miike Snow last night great Show!\n\nI am used to the configuration split between 21+ and 21-.  It is easy to get up front to see everything close and personal.  Sound is usually pretty damn good.  \n\nWhats wrong?  How about turning on the f**king AC for a sold out show in the summer?  My god it was inhumane.  I ended up leaving 1/2 way through the show it was so hot.  I wasn't the only one.  You guys are great business for the bar next door.  It was full of concert goers fanning themselves back to life.\n\nFlip the switch maybe next time?  It is a concert Venue not a Bikram yoga class."
"2","-East End Brewing is a very small operation.  They are located in a small garage type building.  Once inside it's simply just some taps, a small bar area and a merchandise table.  They only sell 2-3 beers in bottles.\n\n-As for the beers, they allow you to sample any of them.  I was a BIG fan of the pumpkin. Besides Southern Tier Pumpking this was my favorite pumpkin beer I had tried up until that point. I also was a big fan of the Harvest beer.  So I took two growlers home of those and bought two glasses. \n\n-I recommend taking a trip there, try the beers, get a growler and enjoy!"
"2","I ate a shaggy dog @mauidogs !  Or a fuzzy dog. I think it was shaggy. It had slaw and all sorts of other stuff on it and I liked it...alot.  I could eat another one right now.  And I would too, if I weren't writing this from a hotel in California.\n\nI also had a spam slider. It was good too.  I haven't had spam since I was, well, it's been a long time.\n\nI like this place...the food, the people, the vibe...nunui!\n\n'Oe pono he ekahi!\n\nhttp://hawaiiandictionary.hisurf.com/"
"2","Great dinner.  Went last night, food was great, wine was great, service was excellent and attentive.  Ambiance was perfect for our dinner party of 4.  Everyone enjoyed it."
"2","Popped into here a few days ago after working myself hard and it had actually been the first time id been in, which is unsual for me as I generally like the odd Starbucks and George Street is my ususal habitat!\n\nIts Kinda cool if you get a little stool at the window, sip your hot beverage and people watch. Unfortunatley Starbucks being as ever popular as it is , is always busy and it can be a bit of a nightmare getting a seat. Id reccommed it for people on the go, however If time , better to head to coffee shop that is not a chain, I think those guys try a little harder and dare I say the quality is a bit better."
"2","To all my CHAIN HATERS out there....DON'T READ MY REVIEW! OK....I'm one of those \""Chain\"" haters so sue me. BUT! I've got to tell you that THIS chain is A-OK! Why? Because their burgers are DARN TOOTIN GREAT....that's why!\n\nYou know, upon thinking about it, you've got to believe that the reason a brand becomes a \""chain\"" is because they have a pretty good product to being with, right? Think of The Cheesecake Factory. Yes, I'm a BIG FAN! Like I am with P.F. Changs, Five Guys Burgers. GREAT food and service (usually). So why not Smashburger? OK Smashburger, you WIN!\n\nHad their \""Big\"" Mushroom Truffle Burger on an Egg Bun. Added bacon and grilled onions. MAN was this ever a SLOPPY burger....just the way I like them! Very juicy and very \""BEEFY\"" meaning, plenty of FAT and not lean. Hey if I wanted lean I'd eat Chicken Breast, right? No Sirloin Burgers here....must be Chuck or something like that. Nevertheless, it really was great!\n\nOh, their fries are parmesean herb shoestrings which were REALLY good! I love shoestrings because they remain crispy, and the flavor that Smashburger imparts on them are really great!\n\nOverall a 4.37 STAR experience! I just wish that they'd offer a Double Burger for us true Meat-a-tarians!"
"1","Horrible customer service ! Every time we visit Las Vegas, this is the go to place to get breakfast before we leave. However, because of this incident, we won't be returning.\nThey even manage to give us the wrong order. We had a hair in our bowl of pho. We asked for two small empty bowls, never got it until we went up to the manager herself and asked... Again. We even asked for three plates of onions. We asked three times, and all those three times, we were ignored. We didn't get it until I had to get up AGAIN and remind them. \nWhen I asked the manager for the waiters name, she hesitated and said his name was \""Phat\"". Which was probably a fake name. \nThis place claims to be number one, but I beg to differ on their service and food quality."
"2","Went to Merkato last Friday. Ordered the salmon dish with rice and injera bread. Good meal! Good price! Big portions too! Better than the Abyssinia restaurant! I will be back! :)"
"2","First time here. Well organized and clean. Very friendly staff. Reasonable prices and large space. Down side ... In rough neighborhood. Wouldn't come alone at night and definitely locked my car. Will come again."
"2","The neo-Coliseum!... where the padded gladiators come to fight other padded gladiators unto the death!  The splendor!  The greatness of our new Rome in PHX!\n\nMy analogy may be a stretch (I am, admittedly, a former FS who loved to hit), but a stadium really does set the stage for a fight, whether it is circa 127AD or 2013AD!  The Cardinals Stadium (now sponsored by a notorious degree-manufacturing institution) creates a great setting for a special game or event.  The stadium is easy to navigate in-person, and the fung shui is generally on par.  That is, it has a relatively \""new\"" feel, plenty of amenities, and great views throughout most of the stadium.\n\nReady for my complaints?  If not, I am:  the online seating charts and visuals suck.  The upper deck is much higher than the lower/ mid-level seats, and anywhere below the upper deck probably even offers a better view from a slanted angel.  Not knowing this, I incidentally purchased two different sets of tickets (one set for a slanted lower-deck view and another for a side, upper-deck view) for the sum of over $500 only to have to sell two for a $200 loss.\n\nThe stadium is also frigid-cold in the winter.  Considering that they have a dome, they open it (probably wanting to save money instead of heating it) and the Western sun blinds (but warms... and even tans!) those in the upper Eastern side.  So, if you are sitting on the Eastern side (especially in the upper portion), bring sunglasses and/ or a hat.  Wherever you are sitting outside of the hot months, bring some warm clothes!\n\nIn all, I enjoyed the stadium and look forward to my next visit.  I hope that my tips help you to have the insight that I wished that I had!"
"1","The food was excellent- P B and J waffle w compote and the Hangover sandwich. But the service was terrible , too many servers trying to service Everyone With no coordination between them. It took way too long-  they brought the wrong coffee and then replaced it w the correct one and charged for both . Manager was too busy trying to explain the mistakes away instead of acknowledging the problems and apologizing  or god forbid comping us for the coffee. Too bad the service seriously detracted from the creativity and qualitivity of the food .\nWon 't be back."
"1","Great looking restaurant.  It was very clean and provides a great atmosphere in line with the Scottsdale culture.  We were greeted promptly and sat according to our preference.  Our waitress came by in a reasonable amount of time to take our drink order.  After she took our drink order it took and excessive amount of time for her to come back for our food order.  My wife and I gave her our food order specifically requesting soy paper instead of seaweed stating the fact that I don't like seaweed.  Our food arrived in an appropriate amount of time.  One of the rolls, the dragon roll, came out with seaweed, and we had to send it back.  We had to ask were the tempura shrimp was in the tempura shrimp roll.  The ratio of shrimp to crab and cucumber was way way off.  As far as the food itself the size of each piece of sushi is 3 to 4 times the size of any normal sushi roll.  This made it impossible to eat with chopsticks in one bite.  I enjoy sushi for the combination of flavors in each piece of sushi and to have to eat a piece on multiple bites makes it so you only get part of the ingredients per bite.  The bill, yikes!  They uncharged $1 for the soy paper which is normal.  Almost $70 for 3 rolls at lunch time!  Overall, the food was mediocre, the size of the rolls was abnormal, the ratio of ingredients was way way off, the price was high, and the service was terrible."
"1","So, most of my reviews are going to be based on the quality and taste of the food.  I don't find that I experience really bad service or great service that often, most is satisfactory.  \nOn with the review.  The bread that they bring at the begining was pretty delicious, but sad when that was the best part of the meal.  Most of us had pasta, mine was extremely bland (I had the creamy garlic chicken)  I had to add a lot of salt and I never salt anything.  My fiance had the fresh tomato mozzarella pasta and it was terribly bland also, the tomatoes hardly even had taste.  The only thing in our group of six that seemed to be good was the chopped gorganzola salad. \nI would much rather support a local restaurant than a chain, but I would have to say that I would rather eat at Olive Garden than here."
"2","I've gotten pretty decent service here.  My old iPod wasn't working well and I took it in (after spending hrs myself trying to figure out what was wrong) to the Apple store.  Though it was WELL past its warranty, they made me an offer to upgrade from my 80 GB iPod to a 160 GB iPod for $60, a brand new iPod.  I took it right away because I knew they cost a lot more than $60.\n\nThat made made super happy because the solution they gave me was much, much better than what I was expecting.  I was super, super happy with their resolution.  I did make an appointment and it was easy to do that on the phone.\n\nWhen our iPhone wasn't working properly, really sucking up too much data, this one took a bit more to resolve through Apple's technical support.  After exhausting them and going to the Apple store, they saw that we were still under warranty by a few weeks and promptly replaced the phone with a new one.  Granted, we didn't have the latest and greatest phone, so I don't know what that would have been, but at least for our issue, they were able to resolve it.\n\nWe should be getting our next iPhone for me tomorrow and we know that Apple will take care of us.  Thanks for doing a great job!"
"1","Came here last Saturday after the Color Run. There was no line and now I know why. The food was awful, the portions were small, and the employees were talking about the customers in Spanish (I know because I'm fluent)! I'd give this place negative stars if I could. Needless to say, I will NOT be back."
"1","Due to the service, I will NEVER go back. I love Indian food and have been to quite a few places in the valley.  Chennai's food was average... when we actually received what we ordered (dinner service). \n\nPros: \n-Relatively fast turn around following ordering.\n-Food was pretty good, if nothing to write home about.\n\nCons: \n-Servers had no idea what was on the menu. They came back twice to ask if \""that 'chinna' thing\"" was a soup and then seemed to point at the menu at random, asking \""is that it?\"" Channa masala. It's a pretty ubiquitous dish. And I can show it to you on the menu if you hand it to me.\n-Of the 6 dishes we ordered, 2 came accurately, 3 were entirely inaccurate (e.g. chaat when we'd ordered a curry dish), and 1 never showed up at all.  \n-They tried to charge us for dishes we didn't order in addition to those we did.\n-We had to ask the waitress for water 3x before she brought it.\n\n\nIf you're going to go there, go for the lunch buffet. The less you have to interact with the servers, the better."
"1","We ordered shrimp dumpling soup and requested 2 bowls, but our server did not think it would be enough for us so we cancelled that order and requested the pan fried noodles with chicken.  We ended up receiving both.  The soup had a curious flavor and the noodle dish was pretty mundane."
"1","I ordered pizza for pickup, once I arrived home I realized there was hair in my food. I simply called back to this location and asked for a remake and for them to deliver it to me. I didn't think this was to much to ask considering it wasn't my fault. I was told that's wasn't an option (all while being super rude) and when I asked to speak with the manager was told there wasn't one even tho when I picked up my pizza I clearly saw a man with a solid red polo shirt on which was different from the rest. They need to work on customer service."
"2","The bedding was AMazing!!! Tv is too slow as in every Sheraton. Too much chlorine in the pool......the service and rooms make up for it. Try staying on a private floor....the club lounge has complimentary breakfast and happy hour snacks! Worth the extra"
"2","Huge beer selection.  Many TVs with the football games on.  Bartender wasnt too friendly tho, didnt make conversation or anything."
"2","I ordered mild, but the food still had quite a kick.\n\nWith that being said, I enjoyed the food.  A rather large group of us went in at lunch time and were seated quickly and served just as fast.\n\nMost of us ate from their weekday lunch special (about $8 per plate).  The lunch special comes with soup and an egg roll.\n\nThe ambiance is nice.  Like a few other reviewers have suggested, you can't really guess what you're getting into from the strip mall appearance outside.\n\nOur waiter was nice and attentive.  He walked the fine line between participating in our group conversation and being creepy really well.\n\nThere are a few Thai places in this area, and Tottie's is one of the better."
"1","The service was great especially for it being so packed. I was told they had the best happy hour, but was less than impressed. I also got the poutine, which was okay...not the best but not terrible. I didn't stay for long, but it seemed like a fun place to go with a bunch of people for expensive drinks."
"2","I've been coming here since I was a kid and it is still the same! The factory tour is OK, and it is interesting to see what they are making that day. My favorite part is the free samples that they give you in the gift shop. It is super ridiculously expensive for chocolate, that is owned by M&M Mars but I guess that's what happens when it is super touristy :(\nThe cactus gardens are beautiful and it is a nice place to take a walk or wear out your kids when the weather is nice. During Christmas time, they decorate the gardens with a ton of Christmas lights and decorations. It is pretty neat to walk around during that time of year."
"2","I have never encountered a restaurant such as this inside of a shopping mall but I was very surprised. I was very impressed to see that the kitchen staff used gloves while cooking the food. There was a beautiful aquarium near the sushi bar. I don't think that there is a breakroom for the staff, however, because those that were on break were milling about near the kitchen talking and joking around. It really ruined the atmosphere of our dinner. \nThe food was tasty however the sushi was bland. I've had much better at actual sushi restaurants. \nIf I ever find myself back in the Scottsdale area again I'll probably eat here."
"1","Ok so my friends talked me into going back and giving it another shot.  Mistake.  If possible, service was even worse.  I was there on Thursday evening and when we arrived it was virtually empty.  The servers would literally walk by our table and look at us but not come over.  We finally talked to the manager, Mike, and that helped.  The food was very good this time.  Still not a place I would choose to go."
"1","12/03/12\n\nHmm... I could've sworn I had written a review of this place before.  At the very least, I uploaded a few pics of our breakfast here many months ago.  Took my Mom to try the oven-baked pancakes once.  Do yourself a favor and pass on these!  Guess the review AND photos were taken down.  (Let's see how long this NEW review sticks before it's taken down, too.)\n\nCousin texted me yesterday and asked if I'd join her for breakfast at JP Pancake today, and I texted her back guessing that it was too late to warn her not to buy the Groupon... Yes, it was.  I thought it would be a good opportunity to see if JP had improved on its service and food prep.  As you can see, it hasn't...\n\nWe arrived around 7:35 am to see a deserted parking lot with the exception of one car parked in front of JPP.  It looked like we were the only souls there, besides our server and the cook in the kitchen.  I thought perhaps we'll get better service this time, since we were the only customers.  The young man asked us to sit wherever we wanted, handed us the menus and asked if we'd like some coffee or juice to start with.  I asked for coffee, while my two cousins settled on hot cocoa.  He said he'd see if they had any in the back first.  He came back a few minutes later with their mugs of cocoa (Swiss Miss and canned whip cream) and said he'd be back with my coffee.  Upon his return, we placed orders of a \""Golden brown\"" waffle ($6.25), two full orders of French toast (one with strawberries, one with bananas, $7.95 per), and two sides of bacon (3 pieces each, $3.25 per).  I later asked if the side of ham is off-the-bone, and after consulting with the cook, he came back with a \""yes.\""  I placed a late order of that, as well.  \n\nWhile the service was good (food arrived fast, server checked back to see how we were doing), the breakfast we had wasn't as good.  Our French toast slices http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jp-pancake-scottsdale?select=Q5s2HavHzD9RrGJOUbx0NA#Q5s2HavHzD9RrGJOUbx0NA were very dry-- the menu stated challah bread, but I think it was more like cake, and the slices could've used a longer soak in the egg batter.  Out of the six halves on my cousin's plate, she only had one (and all but one of her berry slices!), while I had one slice and a quarter of another of my platter.  I would've suggested we share a plate, but she didn't want to get bananas, and I didn't want any berries...  As I've said, the only winner this morning was the waffle, and I think the dollops of butter had a lot to do with its success.  (Also, I brought my own bottle of organic pure maple syrup, since most restos offer up a non-organic cane and corn syrup blend.  My cousin tried mine first before trying the restaurant's own syrup, ditched that, and then used mine until she was finished eating.)  Their sides of bacon http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jp-pancake-scottsdale?select=OP_6MgCnCpDWtxi8JJAijg#OP_6MgCnCpDWtxi8JJAijg were very costly, considering that these were very thin slices and VERY greasy (even for bacon!).  I wouldn't hesitate paying $3.50 for a very nice plate of THICK-SLICED bacon, all-natural even, but these were pathetic-looking.  As unfortunate-looking as they were, however, they did save breakfast for my cousins.  As for the miniature slice of ham http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/jp-pancake-scottsdale?select=cHiSI19XYV1wUDemaXumCA#cHiSI19XYV1wUDemaXumCA I was presented with, I sent that back.  I may have been a fool to agree to waste my calories on a horrible breakfast this morning (thinking it was time to give JPP another chance for improvement), but I'm not that big a fool to allow my cousin to be charged another $3.25 for a paltry serving!\n\nAlso, zero props to our server who freaked my cousin out by hugging the wall by the kitchen with what I thought was the hope of keeping out of our vision while being able to hear our conversation without success!  Her sister confirmed seeing this behavior and thought it was very creepy, too.  I wished they'd alerted me sooner (by asking me to switch seats) so that I could see what they were talking about.  Overall, what a lousy way to spend $35* and a breakfast meal out!  :(\n\n*Original ticket was just under $45, which showed the order charges totaling under $38 before tax.  If you account for Scottsdale's food tax of 8.95%, what was the extra $3, or so, for?  A hidden tip?  Finding this hidden charge was surprising, because our server did not know we were using a Groupon.  There was a sign on the door that stipulated that all Groupon customers will be charged an 18% tip at checkout, and my cousin did not mention her Groupon until we were given the check.  Perhaps, just perhaps, JPP assumes that all of their customers are Groupon-users?  Not far-fetched, since the Yelp reviews can't be helping JPP these days..."
"2","I brought my bike in, and within 10 minutes they had me out the door with a new tire. Very knowledgeable staff! The food is delicious as well."
"1","I've been here several times and have been disappointed each time. The service is good, the atmosphere lovely but the food is below average especially when you consider the price."
"2","On time - big plus - reasonable - bigger plus - and  done efficiently ."
"1","Waitress (jen) was nice but we waited very long for the food. Food also not too tasty. Ordered the chicken crepes and were cold when they came out."
"2","I got the exotice fruit crepe which was good.  It came with a scoop of coconut gelato.  I thought the geleto taste better than the crepe.  Its about $15 for a crepe here, which I thought was a lil pricey.  I think the next time, I'll just go to Paris hotel for crepes.  But the gelato here was great.  The coconut gelato had lil bit of coconut pieces in it and it was sooo creamy."
"2","Great \""modern mexican\"" place.  Don't go here looking for anything authentic.  It is certainly on the pricier side of mexican food, but it is fairly priced for what it is.  \n\nWe ate here late on a Saturday night and got the \""front and center\"" outdoor table.  We had a blast, as the people watching on a nice night is outstanding (WHERE do all of these crazies come from, really!!??)\n\nSo long as you know what you are walking into here, you'll have a great experience."
"2","I have taken my dog Stella here I think three or 4 times.  I love the owner and anyone I have come in contact with.  Stella is happy to be there."
"1","Went yesterday for lunch and ordered the sampler platter. The tri-tip was full of fat with no flavor, the small dark meat piece of chicken barely had any meat on it and even though my guest ordered her same meal with no cabbage or rice they still put it on her plate.  I will not be returning ...."
"1","Another Mexican place that makes Americanized Mexican food that reliance a on lots of cheese and salsa.  Nearly everything looks and tastes the same.  If you want American Mexican, flowing chips and salsa and sweet margaritas, there is always a crowd."
"2","Yay, I am a fan! This little spot has been consistent in providing fast, delicious Korean food. Typically I order Chop Chae which are pan fried noodles w/ vegetables & beef with a side of Kimchee.. with a drink it typically comes out to about $11 and the portion is HUGE. Usually my sister and I split it and still have some left over. Service is not bad or great,  professional and to the point  -- I really don't expect or require anything more from small joints such as this. Definitely recommend."
"2","The love...compassion.....dedication....PAYMENT PLANS will never be forgotten...true animal lovers the care they providedexceeded  my expectations. I am so grateful to the warm loving hearts. The knowledge was amazing the discussion and description of everything was amazing this truly is a place to take your loved animals.got won't find better :-)!"
"1","Greyhound in Pittsburgh gets no stars based on my experience today. I had a ticket to get on a bus to Columbus, Ohio at 7:45 am. So did 30 other people. Only 3 people got a seat. They were filled by people who were returning to the bus. No-one apologized to us. We were given the to get on a bus for Cleveland, but no-one at the gate could tell me the itinerary, or when I would arrive at my final destination. I had to wait in the ticket line to find out. I had to cancel my plans to meet friends and family today. I did get a refund, but it wasn't with a smile. I have never had such a negative experience travelling. Thank goodness Megabus is expanding."
"2","Nice station. Wish they had Window squeegee so I could've scrubbed all the bugs off! Sams does have best Prices. Was 3.54 today for 91 octane. I will definitely venture to this fuel station though from now on!"
"1","Probably the worst Embassy I have stayed at (and unfortunately I stay here often for business related trips).  This is the older model Embassy that looks like a reformed apartment complex.  Rooms need a facelift much like the lobby is currently getting.  The staff is decent, rooms are relatively clean.  I would look at other options if vacationing in Tempe though."
"1","Over priced for you get...don't believe the hype. Three people, 3 sandwiches and 2 fries, $45.00 at a walk-up. And if you have high-blood pressure avoid those fries.\n\nDisappointed local."
"1","This place is fine, but I think if I ever go again it will be because it is the only thing in its area that has late-night food. Otherwise, I don't think it's anything special for regular lunch or dinner hours. It's not bad, but I don't think it knows what it wants to be. Food is good enough: hot beef sandwich, vegetarian burger, calamari, fries. Everything was fine, just not really \""special.\"" The best thing was the small side of coleslaw, in my opinion. There are many other more exciting restaurants in Madison. That said, the prices were reasonable, and the place isn't pretentious."
"2","First I'll tell you why I gave this a 4 star and not 5.  We went to Vegas for UFC 100 and came here on a Saturday, it was so packed that we could not sit down anywhere!\n\nNow the good stuff...YOU MUST COME HERE!  ALL the women are gorgeous and it lives up to its reputation.  Check it out for yourself.  Talk to your VIP host or concierge, you could get a free limo ride (but no free cover) but most cab drivers till take you here and will pay for your cover too (they get a kick back).  Again, definitely stop by this place if you're in Vegas."
"1","Ya there's nothing like a stroll through this capitalist antfarm to make me fear for the future of humanity.\n\nIf you're looking for a WWJD-embroidered snuggie, tho, they probably have it."
"2","the cocktails are great. fresh ingredients. can't go wrong with letting the bartender choose your drink or make an off-the-menu concoction inspired by your likes.\n\nthey've mastered the speakeasy theme; their decor aligns making you feel as if you're sitting in a forgotten library.\n\nwhen last we were there, the bartender shared that GQ had recently featured a cocktail on their menu. i can't remember its name, but it was tasty. \n\ndefinitely a breath of fresh air and provides huge contrast to its upstairs firehouse scene."
"2","Man I wish we had this in Texas!\n\nOnce I booked my trip to Vegas I made it my mission to go here at least once. We stopped by on a Saturday morning and yes, there was a wait list, but it moved quickly.  \n\nI had to try the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict from Man V. Food and it didnt disappoint. When it's first laid in front of you you begin to question what the hell you signed up for. Then you dig in and realize that it's all good (almost). It's a lot easier if you attack it a layer or 2 at a time. If you cant finish all of it, at least knock out the fried chicken, mashed potatoes, and the cream sauce. Those were the best parts. The fried pasta and the tomato dont really add anything special. Next time I come I want to try something with a bit of sweet to it instead of something entirely savory. The price is on point and pretty fair considering the amount of food that you get. The drinks can make your bill jump, though. Stick to maybe 1 juice and some water.\n\nOverall the service was very speedy and friendly. Another thing I loved about the place was the music! During my time there I heard The Black Eyed Peas, Prince, Aaliyah, Sade, and Zhane! Now that's what I'm talking about!\n\nIf you're looking for a massive breakfast with a twist, I say go for it. Just prepare yourself for the food coma afterwards."
"2","I thought it was time to write about the amazing facial I had at Life Spa with Bethany. \n\nMy skin felt great from all the wonderful products, my shoulders and scalp felt great from the awesome massage, and my wallet felt great from using my new member ticket!\n\nEveryone was very kind and professional -- from the girl that greeted me to Bethany to the girl at the front desk who asked me how everything went. \n\nTwo things I thought were really great:\n1) Life Spa doesn't use bottled water. They instead offer you filtered water in a real glass. I dislike those mini bottled waters and I think they taste worst than filtered water. \n\n2) My scalp massage. My brain felt like it was on vacation for the entire facial. So relaxing and so wonderful."
"1","Honestly disappointed with the service.  They require additional deposit on cash or debit card (?!) payments, $50 per night!  The hallways are noisy, you can hear everything from adjoining rooms.  Breakfast is $14 per person, kind of ridiculous because there are virtually no restaurants in the area.  \n\nGo elsewhere in a cooler neighborhood if you're staying here for fun."
"1","$9 for 1 damn scoop of ice cream!!!!!!  I stopped here to get one scoop of icecream in a cone and they charged me $8.58!!!  I know this is Vegas but damn!  The scoop was average size and it didn't even taste that good. Never again!!!!!!"
"2","The best place in Charlotte. They are consistent with there service and quality of food. Me and my fianc\u00e9 dine here weekly. Never had a bad experience."
"1","After having wait 45 minutes to check in I finally made it to my room. It was like one of those old run down hotels out in the middle of nowhere! Ice maker was broke, bed was hard and very uncomfortable, buffet was HORRIBLE! I wouldn't stay here again if it was free!"
"1","This was good when it first opened but is now indistinguishable from the Americanized greasy spoon Mexican fare that you get everywhere else in Phoenix. \n\nPrices are okay, chips and salsa are included (and the chips are served warm) and the portions are enormous. But the food isn't particularly interesting, relying too heavily on fat and carbs and not enough on interesting flavors.\n\nEvery time I go, want Abuelo's to be a classy Mexican restaurant that distinguishes itself through a refined Mexican palate not a substitute for Macayo's."
"1","I'm sitting here and listening to the worker complain loudly while I eat. First it was the way people closed, then it was their green cards and then who knows what else. The ice tea had three cubes of ice, the hash browns were cold and the toast was dry. No melted butter on the toast."
"1","This was the 3rd salon I tried out in Vegas after Diva's Studio and Limelight Salon. I came in for a a cut only. The stylist I had was real nice, and at that time had 2 years experience for hair. I asked for a bob cut. I liked she used scissors to cut my thick asian hair. My hair was shorter than I wanted and I wasn't too impressed by how the bob turned out. I wasn't too thrilled I spent $55 for it either. \n\nI guess it's worth trying if my friends in the hospitality industry and at my government job were getting nice cuts here...Just not for me."
"2","This place is definitely hidden in the corner but it was great all the same! The staff is super friendly and the actual racing was so much fun! Once you get the hang of it, there is no stopping you. A little pricey but still a great place to come every once in a while."
"1","Twice in less than a month I have been affected by the irresponsibility of the employees at Fitness Connection. I've waited in the parking lot for someone to show and open the gym. There's nothing like waking up at 4:40am, getting dressed and driving to the gym to realize you've wasted your time and sat in the parking lot for 30 min. Who knows when this employee actually showed, because we all gave up. It's time to hire responsible employees that show to work on time. You threw off my Monday."
"1","This is my third time in Las Vegas and I choose the Luxor to stay at because it looked fun and enticing. At check-in we paid a 20 dollar a day resort fee, it wasn't a problem until we realized that you don't get much for the fee. On my last two stays I stayed at the tropicana and should have stayed there on this stay. The Luxor hotel is run down and not taking care of. The windows in our room were dirty through out our stay. The resort fee included wired internet services really I didn't know that still existed. The wi-if they offered was only for 48 hours and only worked in certain parts of the hotel. The towels were hard and cheap. The only good thing about our room was the bed and the pillows. On our first night here we decided to eat at the MORE buffet BIG disappointment. The  food was the same for lunch and dinner and it wasn't a  wide variety of selections. The next time I come to Vegas I will stick with what I know and stay at the tropicana. Very very disappointed...."
"1","Buyer be aware. \n\n Test drove several vehicles.  Found one that would fit my needs.  The auto had a clean car fax report, was certified by the dealership, and had one not so obvious defect.  The Sales person and GM said the defect was easily fixed. It was not fixable.  This ended the deal.  Recommend that any pre-owned vehicle considered for purchase be seen by your own mechanic.\n\n The finance person was all smiles until we declined an extended warranty on the auto with the \""fixable\"" defect.  The loan through this dealer was 1% higher than the other dealership where we finally purchased a vehicle.  So, check with your bank or credit union before negotiating a loan.\n \n Their web site is easy to navigate but not always accurate.  One car which has been sold has been on the site for over three weeks.  Earlier in my search, I contacted the sales staff to set up an appointment to test drive this car.  When I arrived I was shown a different car.  The car fax report would not open on the site for this auto; perhaps that was a clue as to the true status of the vehicle. Latter I was told that the car I requested had sold and that their internet staff was over extended and unable to update the site at times.  Oddly enough, other vehicles are posted and removed in a timely manner.\n\n Ultimately we went to another Infiniti dealership for far better treatment.  At this dealership, the final price was agreed and no additional fees were added.  The financial officer was kind and did not try to bully us or imply that we were stupid for not buying an extended warranty.  The finance department was able to offer the same loan rate as our credit union.  Overall the experience was less stressful and more straight forward than that experienced at Park Place Infiniti."
"2","Yum, yum, yum!  \n\nDelicious food and fantastic, friendly service.\n\nOrder the Pork Tenderloin, and definitely get the side order of Chile Relleno - it's spicy, but so tasty I didn't care that I started to glisten... I looked at it as a bonus that my metabolism was kick-started!\n\nBonus (for some) is you get to walk by the Pussycat Dolls gambling area on the way to the restaurant."
"2","I'm a fan of Ted's! One of my fiance's old co workers told us to check out this restaurant. We really liked it!\n\nThe people have always been friendly, and the price is unbeatable. We actually haven't been in awhile, and funny how I brought up this place again today. I'm sure we'll be going back real soon!"
"1","Unbelievably unprofessional and unreliable service.  Despite calling ahead and later re-confirming the reservation time, a cab hadn't even been assigned to our 18 year old 45 minutes AFTER the scheduled pickup time.  She was left standing in the dark in a questionable neighborhood for over an hour - only to end up lucking upon a late bus to get her back to campus after an evening appointment.  Consider all other options before calling Yellow Cab; and be prepared to still have to come up with another way to get where you're going if you do decide to give Yellow Cab a try."
"2","My favorite Thai place in Madison. Ordered the C5 (panang curry) and C6 (panang curry with stuffed chicken wing). Both were excellent. I've never had a bad dish there."
"1","My wife and I are in our late 20's. We were just in Vegas. Maybe it was a bad day to go there but we had a very bad experience. The service was very bad. Other people around us were sitting up to 15 minutes before being served or being asked for a drink..not even WATER! Other servers walked by, but if it was not their section they did not stop for help. Same went for us. After we ordered, we waiting an additional 20 minutes for our beers which were poured earlier and our food had the taste of heat lamp.\n\nMy wife and I will most likely not return."
"2","Simply the best thing to happen to the Phoenix technology community ever, period."
"1","I was hungry and it was late . I did not feel like eating McDonalds or any of the other garbage on the strip . My friend told me that there is a Korean restaurant that's open pretty late so I decided to try this place . I had the tofu soup which was not spicy and lacked flavor . I also had their dumplings which did not taste that good ."
"2","Literally, this place has the best burger I've eaten in my entire life. So good I went two days in a row. I make it a point to come here every time I visit Vegas. \n\nOnly problem, which I can't dock stars for nor would I, this place is only in Vegas. Please please please open up a restaurant in LA!"
"1","I saw Dr. Kahlon. He barely looked at me and preferred to talk into a recorder in the computer. I received almost no information from him about my condition although I had been in the hospital. (My insurance did not cover the cardiologist I had seen at the hospital.)  If I had not read about my condition online, I would be in the dark. Kahlon has no bedside manner. He was dismissive and acted almost like I was wasting his time. I changed cardiologists."
"1","I had lunch here and ordered Linguine Ai Frutti Di Mare, Trevi's signature dish. I was not impressed at all. It was a tad bland and not worth the $28.95 price tag. Service was okay, but server didn't stop back after serving the dish until it was time for the check. I've had better pasta dishes from local chains and restaurants than Trevi. I wouldn't recommend as a fantastic place to eat because I'm sure there are some actual fantastic Italian places in Vegas."
"2","This place has my vote for best Pho (Vietnamese soup) in Montreal. They have excellent Imperial Rolls and Spring Rolls. Try the iced coffee which is brewed right in your cup at your table while you eat your main meal.\n*Closed on Tuesdays!*"
"1","Lunch prices were very high for the quantity and quality of food provided.  Pasta with Marinara was bland.  The \""Sea Bass\"" was a very small fillet, looked to be tilapia.  Double charged for the \""meat and cheese\"" appetizer, it was a few shavings of prosciutto, pieces of cheese, and a few olives - not $30 worth.  Keep walking and find another place to eat.  PF Changs was actually the best quality meal we had on this trip to Vegas."
"2","When i went to fry's today it was a great experience. looked like they just went under a re-model and i think it makes the place look much more clean and welcoming. Also, the staff there was very nice! since it was under remodel i had no clue where everything was and the front end manager helped me out! very sweet nice people working there!"
"2","Wow. Excellent atmosphere. Good drink selection (even if Canada hasn't embraced America's IPA). Only had one dish, a seaweed tart, but it was absolutely fantastic (think improved Philadelphia roll delivered via tart sans salmon).\n\nThis place is cozy. In a good way cozy. It is absolutely wonderful."
"2","Ice cream cookie sandwiches, sorbet, and smoothies late at night?\n\nWhat an awesome idea!\n\nThe guy in the store was super nice and this place just makes me jealous of Tempe."
"1","Gross! Food was horrible and this place was dirty! To top it off I had a 10% off coupon for my entire bill & they didn't even do that right! I was very disappointed and even thought the lunch buffet was $8.99 it wasn't worth it for what we ate! Gross & will never be back!"
"2","Great beer, food and tequila with excellence service and plenty of TVs for watching sports. We found this place to be underrated."
"1","Highly overpriced and food was cold. Our waitress seemed confused and didn't know the menu. She had no idea about gluten free. The gluten free bun was awful."
"2","This Starbucks is my favorite! I stop in fairly frequently and the service is always consistently great! It is a very busy location so wait times are sometime long, but it is always worth the wait. The atmosphere inside is nice, very relaxing, and not crowded at all. The baristas are friendly and remember the regulars. The only downside to this location is the parking situation. There are not many spots and sometimes the drive-thru line can back up making it hard to manuver in the lot. Aside from the parking issues I recommend this location when people are looking for a great Starbucks!"
"1","$3 mixed drinks got us in.  The empty bar, techno music and lack of anyone else made us leave after our first drink.\n\nWalked by later.  Place was packed with girls sitting around and a bunch of dudes turning it out to Rihanna on the dance floor...not that there's anything wrong with that."
"1","Hi please rape my wallet and then screw me over on customer service and delivery time.  So I ordered a custom white leather sectional from Bassett - I have other pieces from Bassett that were not custom and therefore I received immediately.  The quality is excellent but I AM REELING from my most recent experience here.\n\nWhen I ordered the sectional I paid by check in full up front and was told the order would be 6-8 weeks for delivery.  It has been ten weeks and I was just told it would be another two.  \n\nNot comfortable with this change in events I said I wanted to cancel my order.  They are apparently saying I cant cancel a custom order.  So what if it takes a year????  Am I still expected to keep waiting??  \n\nSo I told April (who works as a sales person or something there)  that they should at least refund my shipping cost or do something to maintain this customer relationship.  She says 'Probably we won't do that, you will have to talk to Carla and we have great relationships with our customers' .  Oh really?  By doing this to them?  And btw Carla hasnt returned ANY of my phonecalls!!!  \n\nShe said 'All custom orders take longer than 6-8 weeks'.  So I said 'Why did Kevin  (my salesperson) tell me that it would be 6-8 weeks then?  Is he new here?'  Of course the answer is that I was MISLEAD KNOWINGLY by the sales staff and once they got my check for nearly $5k they completely stopped concerning themselves with my order.  So yes I feel USED AND ABUSED but lesson learned...sigh.....Please be exceptionally careful with any Bassett store and NEVER BUY CUSTOM FURNITURE!!!!!!  I hate you Bassett!!!  (P.S. I will be honest and update this review if it comes sooner by some miracle from heaven or if they refund my shipping cost.)"
"1","Average for the strip, which unfortunately is pretty poor. \n\nDecor: typical higher end for strip restaurant. Sushi bar area and lounge area in addition to dining and area. \nDress: Casual\nQuality: Cut and appearance is above average.\nPrice: High end ($50 per person, not including drinks)\nFood: Other than presentation, the food is exceedingly average in taste which is unfortunate. Normally I've give it two stars, but for the price I have to drop it to one. \nThe only bright spot was the dessert.  Excellent presentation and flavorful. \nStaff: Some appear a bit clueless, others are very attentive."
"2","Have had several Lomi Lomi massages at the Scottsdale spa and this was my first time at the Chandler location. I had Julie, who was just new to doing Lomi Lomi. She was very good and with some practise and doing more she is going to be an excellent Lomi Lomi therapist. The Chandler location is clean and the front desk staff is friendly and welcoming. The prices are very good, especially when you take part in their New Therapist specials. Would recommend Julie for a Lomi Lomi."
"2","G&V is the rebranded Missoni Hotel. From what I can see nothing but the name has changed. The staff are still in their kilts and it is still as fluorescent as it ever was. \nNice to have table service, complimentary popcorn at your table and they also have prosecco on tap. \nNice for a catchup with the girls."
"2","Had a great time! Unfortunetly they were out of bottle service when we arrived and we had had to get in line. We got in after a short wait no problem though. Alot of stairs to go up but the drunkness didnt let me remember much of it. It was pretty packed but all vegas clubs are. Not as big as some of the other clubs. Cant really remember much of the drink prices because i inly bought one since i showed up already faded. Love the music,only down side i would say not much wiggle room but cant expect much out of a packed night when theres a dj that everybody wants to see. Not my favorite vegas club but wouldnt mind going, bottle service in advanced for sure next time! They have good djs headlining there all the time, the night we went datsik was playing and they tore it up!"
"2","We came for a Saturday lunch, and it was only 2/3 full. The menu is pretty big including chinese and mexican dishes. Maybe that is why some of them are outstanding while some of them are not good. \nThe duck tongue taco is to die for. The favor, the texture, and the garnish went soooo well together. I can come back only for this!!\nthe quail egg Sui Mai was very refined and you can really taste a true meaning of Asian Fusion.\nThe wonton noodle soup is just a very ordinary but overpriced noodle soup. Not recommended. \nviva China taco was the worse of the meal. The beef tendon was so sticky and the oyster was not fresh. \nthe infamous 20-veg fired rice was not bad but not as special as i expected.\ngreat place to visit once because it is very special."
"1","I'm not sure how we got here, but wow what a WASTE in calories.\n\nWhat's interesting is this place has three types of rice (Mexican Rice, Rice Pilaf, and Fried Rice), what's funny is all the rices taste the same and was way too soggy. \n\nWhats even more funny is that the mac and cheese tastes just like the rice. Whats ridiculous is that the green beans have no taste at all. To put it over the top, the meatloaf and salad bar is horrible. \n\nThis place looks busy, but really it's just not, it's much smaller in space than Hometown Buffet and the clientele seems to be a lot bigger than Hometown's. I think I saw a good amount of people that are being paid by SDI for being too obese to work. \n\nI'd rather go to hometown and I really hate that place!  \n\nI will not visit again.."
"1","Last night my honey and I went through our usual \""what do you want for dinner?\"" routine, where both of us try to avoid choosing. He said \""Greek sounds great\"", and I thought so too. So, I pulled out my trusty Yelp Android app, and we picked Posidon because of all the amazing reviews.\n\nWe were so excited to try a new place close to home, and it smelled quite good when we walked in. The waitress informed us it was her birthday, and that service might be a bit \""slow\"". No worries there, that was ok with us after a long day. \n\nWe ordered spanakopita as an appetizer, he ordered a gyro with no tomatoes and french fries, and I ordered the beef souvlaki sandwitch with Greek salad. \n\nLet me preface the food review with this: I LOVE food. I love going out to eat. I'm very forgiving of mistakes, and kind when I correct them. Out of my 56 Yelp reviews, only 4 have received 1 star, and all for a very legitimate reason. I really go out of my way to give places ample opportunities to correct my frustrations, and few places are lacking in their ability to make me happy. That said, on to the food. \n\nSpanakopita: It took awhile to come out, and it was not terribly appetizing to look at. The two pieces were drastically different in size, but that wasn't the worst part. The spanakopita was luke warm/cold, tasted like it came from the frozen food aisle or had been sitting out for weeks. It was bland, not at all flaky, and the texture was really weird. Oh, and the tzatziki sauce was the worst I've ever tasted, including the months past due grocery store kind that I kept in my fridge as a poor college student. The waitress didn't bother to come back and ask how it was.\n\nGyro with fries: The meat was flavorless, cold, and smothered in tomatoes (he specifically said to leave them out) and that terrible tzatziki sauce. The fries were cold and awful. HOW do you mess up fries???\n\nBeef souvlaki with salad: The beef was tougher than shoe leather, and the leather would have had more flavor. The tzatziki (yes, I'm saying it AGAIN just to emphasize) was TERRIBLE. Oh, and the salad. If you could even call it that. It came in a bowl with a fat blob of yucky dressing, close-to-gone onions & tomatoes, with 2 olives, no feta, and lettuce that looks like it had been trampled on by a herd of zebras.\n\nWe tasted each other's dinner to double check, talked quietly, and confirmed that it was the worst dinner (I told the waitress this in an apologetic tone) we'd ever had. The plates were thrown together like they didn't care, and the service was sub par.\n\nThe WORST Part: The waitress saw us not eating, came over and asked how dinner was. I politely said it was terrible, and started listing off our grievances. Then a woman, who was apparently the \""boss lady\"" came over to see what was wrong. I've never been so insulted in my life. When my bf said that the gyro meat was cold and bland, she said \""well they cut it off the rotisserie and put it on the grill\"". He politely told her that he knew that's how it worked, but that it wasn't hot. She said \""Well, that doesn't make any sense. We're known for the best gyros in town, and we have 4 & 5 star reviews on Yelp\"". Ok so we're totally making all this up, then. *scoff* She said \""sorry\"" and walked away. No offer to replace the food, or take a portion off our bill. \n\nSo we paid $22 for food we said was terrible, with nothing but a condescending apology to walk out of the door with. FYI, we paid for our food (we regret refusing to do so), and left all but 2 bites of each dinner on the table. \n\nI'd give the place another chance if the food were the only bad thing. But with that terrible service, I wouldn't step foot in there again if my life depended on it."
"1","I have visited quite a few nail salons in the Charlotte area and I typically get a manicure or pedicure every few weeks. My friend comes here and recommended it so I came in. \nSimilar to other experiences we went to the nail bar and I had a gentleman ask what service I wanted and like usual, I asked for a gel manicure. He filed the top of my nails then quickly asked another woman to come over and do them. My friend even joked with him that he must hate doing gel nails to which he laughed. She was nice and conversational. They offered me wine which was a nice perk after work. After some talk with the nail technicians and choosing a color, we discussed why it was so difficult to get my last polish off (had them done somewhere else). She commented that some gel polish is better than others and held up the color I choose and said mine was easier to remove than say...OPI. She wasn't kidding. I got a chip in my thumb polish the day after and now, one week after, three of my nails have size-able chips in them (she did 3 coats). I've never had gel chip so easily and have so many tiny air bubbles. \n\nWould recommend for a quick, basic manicure or polish change because they are efficient and polite. There were a few hiccups in customer service. They didn't mention until after services and while I was paying that they take cash tips only which I don't remember seeing posted anywhere and definitely wasn't mentioned before or during service. Luckily, I had enough for my friend and I. Cute atmosphere and quick service is what got this place two stars."
"1","I have been here several times because it is a favorite go to place at my company due to its proximity.\n\nThey are open for breakfast and lunch only. The lunch food for me has been consistently terrible. \n\nI cannot recommend it for lunch."
"1","Internet Connection  = $60 \nWi-Fi router = $120 \nDaily internet pass = $4.95\n\nLosing customers because you make them pay for wifi access priceless.\n\n$4.95 for a day pass or $29.95 for a monthly pass is just ridiculous, especially when the place is so computer friendly with lots of a/c plugs for laptop users.\n\nIf you are going to just have coffee then miss I's review is right on the spot, but if you are going to work or study and need access to the internet then go somewhere else."
"2","Yummmmm. My girlfriend took my husband and I here on our last day in Vegas and I honestly wish they had one in Seattle. It is a \""barstaurant.\"" We had their kalbi jjim, budeh jjigae, and their rabokki. Everything was delicious and really spicy, just as requested. Would definitely go back when in town again. Nom nom nom."
"1","Hotel is beautiful and if you want to stay at a place where you will be treated like shit, this is the place for you. I stayed here last year and it took me an hour and a half to check in at what they like to call the VIP check in.  Believing it was an isolated instance, I came back this year. I reserved an $800 suite four months ago and it is now 5:00 pm and the room is still not ready. The staff and manager offer no accommodations or apologies and their attitude is that if I don't like paying for a room that I don't get to use, I should stay somewhere else. I assured them that I would on all future stays."
"1","Maybe this place has potential?\n\nThe theme of this bar is nice. Very comfortable. \n\nCame here on a Sunday afternoon, not very busy. We received zero service for a cocktail waitress. Not even a \""Hello\"" . Our party of 5 made about 15 trips to the bar, so she missed out on a decent sized  tab! Even ordered food from bartender. \n\nNot sure if I would go out of my way to visit again.. So many other  Oldtown bars with average to great service from waitresses.. Why come back to ZERO ??"
"2","Thicker/richer curry than other places around town. A great place to swing by in the cold of winter."
"2","This place was the answer to my prayers, since I am currently shopping for upcoming birthdays and want to send packages featuring Arizona-sourced goodies. Thanks to Yelp (and Gabi M.'s review, in particular), Poppa Maize \""popped\"" up on my radar and fit the bill beautifully for my needs.\n\nThis tiny storefront is packed with a dazzling variety of flavored popcorn and an array of packaged choices. I stuck with the $3 (medium) bags and collected a rainbow of flavors. For myself, I grabbed Cheesy Chipotle and Candy Bar Caramel. These didn't sit long at home before I succumbed to the urge to munch! For gifts, I selected Pineapple-Jalape\u00f1o, Cheese & Bacon, and Cookies & Cream. Unfortunately, they didn't have any German Chocolate Cake popcorn in the inventory, but I am dying to try that concoction should it reappear in the future.\n\nWhat was most notable was how friendly the service was. I mentioned that I was trying to shop for locally-sourced items and was offered a copy of the November 2009 Phoenix magazine which featured a compendium of Mom & Pops and local businesses. Not only did this help me with my birthday-shopping research, but also made me feel better about my quest. According to Phoenix magazine (who cites Local First Arizona), \""When you shop at locally owned businesses, your money is recirculated and creates up to 75 percent more tax revenue to our community and state.\""\n\nCall it my way of battling the Great Repression and certain anti-Arizona boycotts that are unfairly damaging this great state's economic health. Aaah, sweet (and savory) economic justice! Crunch... crunch!"
"2","Love their chai tea. The expansion and additions in recent years have been really nice. I remember several occasions when I couldn't find a seat anywhere. So thankful that's not the case now - thanks for expanding! The noise level is usually low enough for working or studying, and the music selection is good.\n\nMy only complaint is the vibe given off by some of the employees. A few times I have felt almost unwelcome in the coffee shop. I am placing my order and the employee could not care less. The \""too cool for you,\"" hipster standoffish attitude can come across unpleasant. Where is the customer service? Smile more, I promise you everything is awesome!"
"1","The Shopping center is ok. I hate driving through it though. Too busy."
"1","Well, here I go again in Vegas with Mexican Food. This place was recommended by a friend but it might have been go there and drink and I missed that part. As a bar it was happening but the food was unimpressive. I got fajitas and it was tasteless and totally forgettable. I knew I had to review it fast before I forgot the entire experience lol. It looks like as a bar this place might be cool. Its across from the Hard Rock so it seems to fill up. However, it felt like locals in there so I am not sure who is filling it up. I will have to hit it on the way home some night and check it out as a bar not a restaurant.\n\nOne thing I found annoying as well, as they charge $1 for chips and salsa?? So I thought wow it must be good, uh.. no.. It was nothing to even recall, in fact I cant remember what it tasted like. So no freebies in this joint."
"1","Never thought I'd write a bad review of this place.  It's been my \""go to\"" neighborhood restaurant for at least five years.  After a long, hard day at work, I often go by myself for some good food and relaxed atmosphere on the restaurant side of the place.\n\nLast night I ordered a gorgonzola burger. My burger came out with a very mild, yellow cheese on it.  I decided to eat it anyway, as I was starving, but mentioned to my server that I had ordered gorgonzola and gotten cheddar.  I declined a different burger, as I'd already started eating and it was fine, just not what I'd ordered.  She came back in a few minutes to tell me that the chef had told her that the cheese *was* gorgonzola, and that cheddar melted brown and gorgonzola melted yellow.  I respectfully disagreed.  \n\nWhen my check came, I was charged for a gorgonzola burger.  I asked that the charge for the burger be reduced to the price of a regular cheeseburger (about a dollar).  This prompted a visit by the bartender, but no offer to adjust my bill.  There was also an extra dollar charge on my bill, which was either for gorgonzola cheese or sweet potato fries -- I couldn't figure it out, and no one came back to answer questions.  I paid the bill, but they have lost a long-time, regular customer."
"1","Stayed at the Hakone Suite, room is fantastic and that's where satisfaction with this hotel stops.   I have never experienced a hotel with so many \""service recovery\"" issues.  I must have heard the word sorry 20 times in 2 days.  It's nice to have staff sorry after a mistake, but, you can't survive in a business that cannot make it right the first time.   We arrived at 1pm and the nice front desk person said, Hakone Suite is not clean yet, I will put in a special request for priority cleaning.  We came back 2 hours later and oops, not ready yet.  The front desk guy said, it takes 3 hours to clean the Hakone Suite and we said BS.  I later talked to the maids who clean that suite and they said it takes 30 minutes.  We decided, screw the upgrade we were willing to pay for and checked into a deluxe king.  Minutes later the \""hotel manager\"" calls me in the room and says, sorry, please stay in that room, we will transfer you to the Hakone Suite very soon.  Well, 2 hours later after 4 pm, no one had called, I called and they said, oh yes, it is ready, we will send up someone to transfer your luggage. Sorry.\n\nNext morning we order breakfast food service.  I ordered 3 eggs and when it was delivered apparently in this hotel when you order an egg, you get 2 eggs so I got a total of six eggs.  LOL.  I called the room service back and said, maybe you should tell people that.  He muttered, sorry.   So, I sit down to eat the breakfast and the sour dough toast could have been used in the LA KING hockey games as a  hockey puck.  I called and oops, they said sorry, we had to order the toast from Caesar's kitchen and it took a long time for it to get here.  Really??  LOL.    The maids never called room service to pick up the dishes that were there when they cleaned.  Oops.  Another sorry.\n\nThe hotel manager called on check out morning and said she would call me back as she wanted to talk to me probably to give one of the many NOBU sorrys.  Well, she never did call back, but, it shows that a fish rots from the head down.  It starts at the top.\n\nSo, if you love beautiful suites, NOBU is for you but don't even think about getting good service and the transparency on the truth of a situation, because, the team at NOBU is clueless.  Sorry."
"2","This review will be short & sweet because you only need to know three words when you walk into Fiamma.  Traditional. Potato. Gnocchi.  Order it and you will not be sorry.  Loaded w/ Lobster, complimented with Cremini Mushrooms & Leeks, all in a Black Truffle Cream sauce.  It's absolutely divine."
"2","I really liked the idea of having my lashes look great without mascara, but was not really sure about what to look out for in quality as prices vary.  I started doing research and end up on Yelp. Kathleen was everything people say about her. She spends time upfront making sure to understand your goal outcome. Then gets to work. I was absolutely amazed at the results. I think my first appointment was at least 3 hours as she doesn't focus on time but on the results. On top of everything I've said so far she also works some weekends which is the only way for me to get my grooming done since I travel during the week."
"2","Service was great.  \nThey have great brunch here.  My girlfriend and I both got eggs Benny and they were very good along with the hashbrowns and salad."
"1","**Warning** Do not order the cooked food here except for burgers and pizzas. It is not edible!! I ordered a cajun jambalaya pasta, a shrimp scampi and their potato soup. Words cannot describe how awful they all were.... I sent back both of these entrees in exchange for a turkey sandwich  for lunch. I gave them two chances but I had to send back my food twice.\n\nThe Cheesecake factory in Riverside, NJ is waaaaaay better!"
"1","This review is for customer service attitude.\nThis cigar club is located right next to the Ravella hotel and we were just lucky enough to stay the nights where they have a horrid horrid horrid (yes it's that bad) band playing live music right at bedtime.\nI don't know how it is in Las Vegas with the noise level but in California, restaurants/clubs right by residences follow a strict quiet policy after 10pm. I have seen police being called to clubs when residents complain.\nApparently they do not have that in Las Vegas.\nThe band started playing at 8:00pm and the first night -Friday, they music went on till midnight. Other people in the hotel had also called our hotel front desk to request that the bar turn the music down. Really, how loud does it have to be when you have tall buildings surrounding the stage to amplify sound anyway?  \nI had called the bar myself and ask to speak to the manager personally.\nBlair, the manager told me that she personally turned the music down twice and that she was watching the meter. She couldn't turn it down any further because she has to run a business. \n\nMight I remind you, there is no business running to be had if there are no people staying at the Ravella so a little consideration might go a long way.\n\nShe also added that there are other restaurants playing live music and she enumerated them one by one. How professional of you to try to place blame on others too. These other establishments were a good distance from the hotel and their music can barely be heard. I would have at least been pacified if Blair had been nice about saying she had to run a business, but no, she was pretty rude. \nIf you're going to risk irritating and keep guests up with loud music, at least let it be good music! \nI don't know about you but why would I want to patronize a place where management are inconsiderate to people that COULD  have come invariably to the establishment. Thank god what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. I check out tomorrow. Goodbye and good riddance."
"2","This is a great place to go if you want to experience some genuine, Pittsburgh culture. Their merchandise is great quality and is covered in all sorts of Pittsburgh (ese) colloquialisms and artwork.  Steelers fans will feel right at home here!\n\nAlso, the staff is very friendly and accommodating and the owner is a real people person. \n\nCheck this place out!"
"2","I just had these today and omigosh! They were sooooo good! I had a chocolate twist, which was huge, I had to share it with my co-worker. I also had a jelly donut and 10 donut holes (I got for another co-worker) and I only spent $3.50! That's such a good deal. I can't even tell they're vegan! Such a great selection."
"2","Very good BYOW Italian restaurant located on the waterfront.\n\nFood : very good. Yeah it's Italian food and we see a lot of similar restaurants in this city, but I have never been disappointed (always pleased actually). They make pretty good lamb, as well as home made pesto.\nThere are several other Italian restaurants on the waterfront in Lachine, this one is one of the best in my opinion.\n\nService : nothing short of excellent. Wait staff always tends to you and makes sure you are satisfied.\n\nDecor : very simple, but elegant. Beautiful terrace with stone floor.\n\nI would definitely bring friends here."
"1","Went here for lunch on Monday - arrived around 11:30am and were one of two tables in the entire place. Despite opening at 11:00am, the overhead lights were still off - they turned them on as we sat down.\n\nThe hostess/waitress/cashier lady didn't greet us; she handed us two sets of menus and grunted something about sitting wherever we wanted to.  We grabbed a table (which was sticky in spots) and browsed the menu.\n\nAfter a brief wait, the same lady stopped by to drop off water glasses and to take our order: spring rolls (with meat), tofu Pad Thai, and Tofu curry (with potatoes, onion, and coconut milk). \n\nThe spring rolls arrived; I'm guessing they had been pre-made some time ahead. They were ice cold and nearly glued to one another. The lettuce was brown on the edges. As I grabbed for the hot sauce, I noticed the spoon was filthy and sticky. The same held true for the soy sauce vessel. Hmmm....\n\nThe Pad Thai had an awesome texture and a great flavor - I really enjoyed it. The curry was tasty - light on spice despite ordering 3-stars, but good.\n\nWe waited a long, long time for a check. After watching another table walk up to the front cash register and then hunt down the absent hostess/waitress/cashier, we walked-up to pay and to get some to-go containers (the portions were massive). We got a grunt or two from the woman; nothing much else.\n\nSo... Vientiane = MEH\n\nFood = 3 stars (entrees were good; spring rolls were sub-par)\nService = 1 star\nValue = 3 stars (lunch specials were a bargain)\nMISC = 1 star (dirty, rundown inside)\n\nMadison is hurting for good Thai places... this one has some potential, but needs to improve in some key areas."
"2","LOVE LOVE LOVE: \n- Great Room Suite with cool couch, comfy bed, jacuzzi tub, and rainfall shower.\n- The Beach and the lazy river for laying out getting ones tan on. And floating in and having hysterical belly laughs with one's bff as she acts like a dolphin.\n- That I won $120 twice in the casino playing nickel machines.\n- Great resturants on site.\n\nLIKE:\n- Yogurt In. Would love but probably responsible for me gaining 2lbs there. Damn you delicious frozen yogurt with my choice of toppings!\n- Views from my room were okay, other people there with us had nicer views in normal rooms (I expected my Suite to be big pimpin')\n- Onsite Shark Reef thingamabobber.\n\nCOULD DO WITHOUT: \n- Elevators at the weekend took forever and would be full. I was there getting married, and some of my guests almost missed a limo to the chapel because of a lack of elevator space.\n- Indoor smoking - but that's all Vegas hotels I suppose."
"1","Terrible, tasteless food\nChicken Asiago sandwich was bland, dry, tasteless.\nChocolate ice cream cup melted\nFrench fries over salted and cold"
"1","Though I've experienced better... \nI still think there's potential for \nthis wannabe-tryin-to-be-boutique\nBut it'll take a WHILE to get there.\nThe Rooms... whell.... still smell\nlike lead-based paint.  The restroom\nis puny.. with no fan, so when one\nshowers... it's moist alllll day loong.\nEach time I stayed at this upscaled\nhostel.. I was placed in room 433.\nWhat does that mean?  I'm right under\nthe \""roof-top\"" bar... It's LOUD....\n\nAnyway... I'll keep my hooves crossed\nand pray mgmt sees the light....\n\nOh... as for Gallo Blanco - I love."
"1","Surprisingly below average. First expect a pretty long wait to get your table of corse because it is in Vegas. Second my wait for the food was around 45 minutes witch was annoying but in my mind this was gonna be the best breakfast ever so It was worth the wait for me. When the food came out I was ready baby!!! AND THE FIRST BITE.....hmm not that good. I got the grilled French toast and a side of biscuits and gravy. I get biscuits everywhere I go just to try everyone's and find the best. This place was not good at all very stale biscuits and cold gravy. Let's move to the French toast, I understand it's grilled however burned should have been the word it overpowered the taste so it did not have much flavor and they give you a tiny little maple syrup to cover 3 HUGE pieces of French toast. Only come here if you are already drunk, I think it would be pretty good then but so is Waffle House. Friendly staff though"
"2","Let me preface this review with a little history...\nI'm married to a chap from England. \nI've been to England. And I eat. A lot. Not too memorable, if you get my drift.\n\nHad I not seen a soon-to-be-opened Scottsdale location, I never would've tried this place. You know, British food and all (keep in mind my British husband who loves these things called mushy peas,  \""Bubble and Squeak\"" and some sort of kidney pie). Ewwww...nuff said.\n\nWell, out of curiosity, I looked up the menu, and off we were to the Tempe location. \n\nIt's VERY dark in here, and I imagine that on some cold, winter day, I'd like to spend a few hours in here drinking beer, listening to the awesome music they play and fiddling around with some of the menu items I haven't tried. And I know that when it's hot here, we all like to hide from the sun a little. But seriously, it's a little difficult to see the menu. And the food. \n\nOn my first visit, I had \""The Porky\"" which has pork, potatoes, apples, onion and sage. It's served with this delicious red wine gravy. I should've stopped after I asked the waitress for a to-go box, but I couldn't stop eating. It was wonderful. As in AWESOME.\n\nToday, I had the Lamb and Mint. It had lamb, rutabaga, onion and mint. Also, that wonderful red wine gravy. Killer good. \n\nAnd by now, you're probably aware that all of these delights are contained in this \""pocket\"" of dough, baked and neatly sliced in two when they serve it. \nIf you sit at the right-hand part of the bar, you can see the cooks prepare all of the food, and it's really quite an art. \n\nThe best thing is this: they have all different pasties for all different tastes...italian, mexican, vegetarian, greek and even an American Thanksgiving pasty with turkey, sweet potatoes, onions, stuffing and cranberry sauce. \n\nCheck out the menu and try this place. ! They have fabulous food, good music and lots of fun beers. \n\nGod save the Queen. And Cornish Pasties...."
"2","I give them 5 stars for their burgers but have to give em 3 for their fries.. It's nice but not AMAZING in my opinion. I'm definitely coming  here again and would highly recommend it. The patties are half an inch thick and it's nice that you can specify how you want the patty cooked. \n\nCash Only! So be prepared or use the arm inside. \n\nThere's parking available but DONT wonder off the premises and keep your car in their lot it will get towed. \n\nFriendly service and while the line may seem long at first it moved really fast. The inside interior is cute and simple, a little rustic even. I like the outdoor seating area where you are sitting in giant piece of rounded wood - I forget the name heheh ..\nAnyways come here and get a double patty, if you're not super hungry and don't have a giant appetite get a double \""little one\"" otherwise get the BIG ONE.. And I got a double little one w cheddar cheesex2 but my next visit will be one cheddar slice and one Swiss - nice balance I think."
"1","They went out of business and kept our $$$$$$ that we had paid for a ride that never happened.  They sent an email promising to refund us but never did.  They don't return phone calls or emails.  I sure hope they never open another business."
"1","I would not return without strong coaxing. The food was nothing special. We ordered one of the skillets. I can't remember the name but it was the only one with feta cheese. Maybe my expectations were off but, when I have ordered skillets at other restaurants, the ingredients were integrated. At The Griddle, each item (scrambled eggs, potatoes, chicken and feta cheese) appeared to be cooked, placed on the iron skillet separately and then served. Additionally, the chicken was dry. The waitress also did not charge us the correct price for egg whites but, my friend did not want to address this as it was only a $1 over what it should have been.\n\nI ordered the French toast as I heard The Griddle on Eastern was known for their French toast. The portion was a good size and they tasted fine. Not wonderful and not bad but, they would not bring me back to this restaurant over another place."
"1","Complete lack of respect for peoples time. Dirty office and a staff that has even less respect for their patients! Don't waste your time waiting here you'll spend less time waiting and get better care in an er!. I have been waiting 1hr and 30 mins past my 2nd appointment. Dr didn't even know why I was there!"
"1","Gone down hill big time\nI have gone to this restaurant many times in my life. In the 60's it was a tavern and bait shop that had boat rental. I had not been to the Nau-Ti-Gal for years, and when my daughter and her BF came up from FL for Christmas we decided to take them there as it is a unique location and I in the past the food was pretty good. Saturday 12/27/14  we got there at 6:30 and the place was dead, which I thought a little odd. My wife ordered the seafood salad, my daughter, her BF and I ordered the Prime Rib special of the night, each meal came with a cup of clam chowder. My wifes seafood salad consided of canned baby shrimp, and canned crab meat on lettuce and tomatoes. The Prime Rib was a dark red color which I later realized was a Sam's pre-cooked Prime, I've had before. Later that night I got a gut ache, which turned into several trips to the bathroom, my wife got it the next morning, I'm thinking it was the chowder. \nI won't be going back to the Nau-Ti-Gal and would not recommend to anyone else..."
"2","Having opened up as a replacement to the Noodle House, and retaining many of its features, Happiness is a Chinese restaurant hidden in the centre of Edinburgh.\n\nFreshly revamped, with a traditional Chinese and yet modern d\u00e9cor - Happiness has a friendly atmosphere, mostly due to the lovely front of house staff.\n\nFood is well priced, and with a vast menu there is plenty of reason to return. However, food takes a while to appear despite the restaurant being mostly empty.\n\nHappiness also does delivery/ collection take away food from its main menu, which is ready quickly and arrives hot.\n\nHappiness is a lovely restaurant and the food is excellent."
"2","I had no clue what I was doing when I went to this restaurant!  I've only eaten Indian food a few times and this is Southern Indian food.  It is also vegetarian which is fine with me as I tend to not eat a lot of meat.\n\nFirst off:  This place is clean!  I mean this place is spotless.  You seriously could probably eat off of the floor.  Wouldn't but could.  Also I think the staff is cute!  All these amazing men running around from table to table.  I had a groupon and you have to tell them upon entering (and the sign on the door will remind you!) but I don't think they treated me any differently due to that.  I think they did kinda laugh at us behind our backs because my 12 yr. old daughter and I had NO clue what the heck we were ordering and we wound up with plate after plate of food!  \n\nThere was seriously enough for an army and the whole thing came to about $40!  So I don't understand other people saying it's kinda pricey.  I think it's a great deal!  I loved the Onion Pakora.  I am gluten free and haven't been able to have onion rings often due to this.  Well, The Onion Pakora is a nice altenative.  I did like the tamarind sauce served with it but I took some home and they were even MORE amazing with my own Roasted red bell pepper garlic aoli!\n\nWe also had Sambar Vidai, which is a lentil dumpling kind of with a stew type sauce.    It was good!  We also got Paneer Pakora (Fried cheese) which neither of us cared for.  Then a Cheese Masala Dosai, which honestly we took home and I fed my daughter for lunch the following day as she LOVED the Masala.  We also took home a coconut Uthappan, which neither of us cared for.  \n\nMy daughter loved the Batata Vada deep fried potato balls covered in chickpea flour.  It was actually a bit spicy for me but she ate them up!  Yeah, I said we ordered way too much food for the two of us.  We actually ate a few more meals out of the left overs...and the waiter was very gracious about not teasing us.  I think he was awesome!\n\nService was fast and great!  I think I would go back and just get onion pakora and an order of Sambar Vadai and call it way more than enough!  If you are ready to try something new I suggest giving them a try!"
"2","Great for take out - ingredients so fresh you'd swear they were grown out back. I'd eat it every day if I could."
"2","I finally had the opportunity to check out Leroy Fox on Friday night, and I was not disappointed.  Since the weather turned a little cooler, we decided to sit outdoors.  The patio has a very nice and cozy vibe and I like the decor. \n\nI had a hard time deciding between 4 and 5 stars for this review... so I will break it down individually. \n\nService: 5 stars - our server was friendly, professional, and on top of things. Way to go! \n\nAppetizer: 3 stars - we ordered the pimento cheese with grilled pita points.  The pimento cheese was a bit on the sweet side which I found a little odd... I would prefer a sharper or spicier flavor. However, the pita was on pointe! It was freshly made in house and had excellent texture & flavor.  I loved the pita but not sure I would want the pimento cheese again. \n\nFried chicken: 5 stars - I don't normally order fried chicken, but had heard good things about theirs.  I went with 1/4 North which consists of a chicken breast and wing.  This fried chicken is without doubt the best I have had in a long, long time!  When I bit into it, there was an explosion of flavor in my mouth... wow!  The crust was crispy and seasoned perfectly. The meat was tender and juicy.    They brine the chicken for 24 hours prior to cooking it and it was absolutely fabulous.  I am not sure what they put into the coating mixture, but it was yummy - I think I detected a hint of chili powder or cayenne pepper.               \n\nCornbread muffin: 1 star - I love a good home-style southern cornbread. Sadly, on my visit, the cornbread was dry and tasteless... it was about as appetizing as a piece of cardboard. I took one bite and was done. \n\nWhite pepper gravy: 3 stars - I am not normally a huge fan of gravy, but this was pretty tasty. They serve it on the side so it doesn't make anything on your plate soggy (which I appreciated). \n\nMac & Cheese: 2 stars - this was the most disappointing part of my meal and I wish I had skipped it. The mac & cheese was made out of Cavatappi (corkscrew) pasta which is ok but just not what I expected.  Also, they used a white cheese as the base. Not a problem, but I would have preferred a much stronger, sharper cheddar sauce.  Overall the cheesy sauce was just not very flavorful.  I was really expecting a more traditional southern mac & cheese like the casserole-style that my grandma used to make. \n\nWine: 3 stars - I had a sauvignon blanc for $7.50. It was ok but served at a little warmer temp than I would have preferred. \n\nBeer: 5 stars - I tasted the Cottonwood pumpkin ale and loved that it was served in a glass rimmed with cinnamon & brown sugar.  Yummy! \n\nCost:  3 stars - I think the prices are a-ok.  Overall, I think our tab came to around $50 for 2 beers, 1 glass of wine, an appetizer, and 2 entrees (before tip)."
"1","Machines are very old - many out-of-order. Premises not very clean.  A tacky place.  Will not go there again."
"2","Absolutely gorgeous place."
"1","My boyfriend and I decided to come here just to try it out and, plus, it was on the way to the grocery store.\n\nAnyway, when we first walked in, it seemed to be extremely large on the outside and in the lobby area. After my boyfriend paid for our meals & drinks, we were escorted to our seats. The interior is beautiful - as well as the tables we ate on! I absolutely loved the decoration pieces - but, honestly, that's as far as I'll go with praises.\n\nWhile I do understand that one shouldn't have high expectations at a buffet, we were still met with disappointment.\n\nThe food wasn't very good and it actually made me sick (nausea) while my boyfriend felt it as well. I'm only writing this review now because I was trying to take care of my stomach. The food was very bland period and while the restaurant itself seemed grand and wonderful - the selections weren't very diverse. It only had the minimal types of food one would expect at a $5.99 buffet.\n\nAnother thing I didn't like were how the selections were laid out as well. Why was the sushi bar hidden? The Mongolian Grill would have been a nice addition if it didn't have pizza, cakes, and cookies next to it. Shouldn't the cakes & cookies be in the dessert section anyway? Speaking of the dessert, they were also laid out by the seafood - which, I personally felt, was something that majorly concerned me as a whole.\n\nThis buffet was not worth the price my boyfriend and I paid for (even if we did get free refills) and for sure, we will not be going back again."
"2","In my opinion, this is by far the best Sushi and Japanese joint in town!  This place is as authentic as you can get for Phoenix, AZ.  My husband and I are addicted to the Chirachi bowl which is packed full of rice, seaweed, and piled high with the chef's selection of the freshest raw fish.  This incredible bowl of deliciousness is $20!  You couldn't find this much fresh raw fish at a restaurant for this price anywhere else in Phoenix.  \n\nIf I get the Chirachi bowl idea stuck in my head, I have to have it and nothing else will satisfy my craving.  Speaking of...I think I'll order one for take out right now!  ;)\n\nI rate Sushi Ken at the highest rating possible: 5 Noms: \""Nom, Nom, Nom, Nom, & NOM!\"" :D"
"2","I don't really understand this place's function, but I was there on Thursday for a free event from the Cosmopolitan... a four course wine and food pairing.  How can you beat that?  Tried some wines, had some (tiny) portions of food, and got to socialize a little bit.  Cosmopolitan is easily my favorite hotel/casino right now, and this place is a great hidden jem!"
"1","I was driving down Lake Mead with my Sister and Nephew and did a double take on this shiny Red Truck in front of Lee's Discount Liquor.  Well, I'm a sucker for trying new things and I was on a food truck high just having recently discovered Fuku Burger that past week....so, even though I was on my way to lunch I busted a U-ee and decided to have a taste. \n\nThe operation is a one man show and the guy was nice enough.  So kudos to the humble service.  However, I can't speak too much about the food.  I was pretty disappointed.  Granted I had high hopes from the look of the truck and the overall concept of \""Fusion Food,\"" the Korean and Mexican flavors didn't quite well...fuse.   I ordered the pork taco and well it tasted under seasoned and the tortilla was just tasteless.  I was hoping for more flavor from the meat and maybe even just a warm tortilla would've have done wonders to add something to this very sad cold taco.  I really didn't even finish it.\n\nI feel bad giving such a bad review, but hey...it's my honest opinion and I wish Hanshik Taco all the best and perhaps he'll try and put some more pizzaz in his food.\n\nThe only reason I gave 2 stars is because the seasoning on the fries were pretty yummy."
"1","The most horrid shopping experience ever! Very few clothing options for customers in their 20'-50's. Most items are geared towards the 60-80 age range. I did find a couple of items to try on and this is where everything totally went down hill!\n\nBack at the dressing room were three employees. Two of them were being scolded by a German or Austrian woman telling them they are not hanging things correctly on displays. All three completely oblivious to my need to try on some items. I finally interrupted and one employee said to go in. One of the tops was cute but it had a hole in it. I asked if they had more sizes in the back as this was the only medium they had on display and I just got \""I don't think so.\""\n\nAfter that disappointing exchange of words, I used the restroom. DIRTY!!! There was feces on the plumbing by the flush lever and on the wall!!! Yes, feces sprayed in places that it should not be. The seat cover dispenser lay on the floor and the toilet paper dispenser was almost meeting it's counterpart, hanging on by a screw. I do not think someone had a wild poop party, I just think their restrooms are seriously neglected. \n\nSo far, starting to see a pattern of neglect. Well, I kept looking...shoes, then purses. I did find a cute purse. Walked up to the register and the clerk proceeded to comment on how cute the purse was. I might as well have been talking to the wall. I responded and the clerk was focused on goings on at another register. The only other verbal exchange after I swiped my card was \""Here you go\"". No \""thank you\"" or \""have a nice day\"". \n\nThe neglect that just oozes out of this store weighed heavy on me and within 2 hours I was back and returned the purse. When asked why I was returning the purse, I said \""Poor customer service experience\"" to which I received an \""Oh!\""\n\nOh, and by the way, I will not be back!"
"1","So when i first moved here all the punk/rock folks i met were like \""dude, you gott a check out the rogue. best dive bar around\"".  But apparently they hadnt been there in a while as now its an emo/dance dive with pretty snooty patrons.  Maybe I went on a bad night but was totally bummed as it has all the makings of an awesome dive. Its dark, the drinks are cheap, and theres room for great bands.  It was indy rock night or some BS when i went.  Not a pleasant experience.  I cannot stand dudes in girl's jeans."
"2","Everyone knows that when you go to a comedy club that you don't want to sit in the front row because you are going to get ripped into. Well, at Vinnie's show it doesn't matter where you sit because he will find you.  \n\nWe went to his show in February of 2009 and I have to tell you that we are still talking about it. He is hilarious. He says things that make you so very uncomfortable. I was torn between dreading the moment he saw me and having the anticipation kill me.  \n\nHis show is very definitely worth whatever the charge is. His show alone will make your Vegas vacation special and something you will talk about for years. \n\nTed's review says it all. The CD's you can purchase after the show are great. Now everyone back home can hear all that went on.  \n\nBest show in Vegas by far."
"1","So I gave this place a two stars because the Pho was good and full of flavor, but the customer service is horribly unacceptable (with the exception of the hostess who was very attentive).  I'm pretty patient, but I literally had to wave down someone to get their attention so I could get a refill on my water.  This is expected when a restaurant is busy, but there was only 2 other parties dining (one being a two-top) and workers just gathered to talk stories. \n\n   After we ate, my friend wanted to order Boba to go.  We waited another 10 minutes before my friend decided she was going to have to wave someone down again.  She got someones attention, but instead of coming up to help us, he yelled across the room and said: \""Can I get you anything else?\""  She went along with it and tried to order from a distance, but when he couldn't figure out what she was saying, he finally decided to approach us at the table.  I took this opportunity to order an Ice Coffee for my girlfriend, but without the ice.  She has a long day tomorrow and wanted the coffee for the next day (which is why I asked to hold the ice).  To my surprise, the cup arrived with it being  1/2 empty!  I've never seen that before! (http://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/gJWJ8YmQK2_oaUSmnbTYiA/l.jpg) Seriously...End of review. I'm never coming to this place again.  *"
"1","Olives at the Bellagio overlooking the fountains we sat inside 8 tonight and after our standard have a drink at the bar moment we proceeded to the table after getting a quick fountain show which is of course a don't miss anytime at the Bellagio especially when It is in tune to Sinatra. \n\nHad lunch here sometime ago and I remember it being good, but the menu was recently changed and not really for the better.  Sommelier was very good and our waitress was excellent.  Breads presented followed by multiple appetizers including\n\n \n Beef Carpaccio* \ngorgonzola polenta, balsamic reduction, parmesan, cipollini onions, scallion cream, garlic aioli.....19 Best I've ever had. \n\n Tuna Tartare* \nspun cucumber salad, crispy rock shrimp, sesame dressing, scallion cream, whitefish caviar.....18 I didn't partake but was told it was OK nothing special.\n\n\n Todd's Caesar Salad \neggless roquefort Caesar dressing, olive oil brioche croutons, tomatoes, shaved parmesan.....15 \nw/ anchovy fillets.....17 Traditional and large to split but dressing taste lacking \n\n Fiery Chicken Sausage \nherbed ricotta cheese, balsamic onions, roasted tomato sauce.....18 OUTSTANDING!\n\n Meatball & Eggplant \nspicy tomato sauce, caramelized onions, imported buffalo mozzarella, hazelnut basil pesto.....18  Very good.\n\nEntrees: Butternut Squash Tortelli \nbrown butter, amaretto cookies, sage, parmesan cheese.....24 their signature dish was outrageous and Don't like Squash.\nRicotta Ravioli \nroasted tomato basil sauce, sweet Italian sausage, garlic bread crumbs.....25  EL PASSO nothing special here.\n\nHawaiian Mahi Mahi \nlime & cilantro basmati rice, ginger bok choy, miso butter sauce, crispy leeks.....39 Another nothing special dish.\nPrime Beef Tenderloin \nLyonnaise potatoes, garlic braised greens, black pepper demi, truffle brie, crispy onions.....51 Small piece of beef for the price but very tasty.\n\nTwo Lobster Fra Diablo specials $54.00 over pasta were both extremely weak, sauce lacking in any taste or substance and lobster one small little tail.\n\nAlthough our waitress was excellent extreme amount of time between appetizers and entrees to the point of where is our food?  \n\nSome dishes great some hit or miss some downright over priced and lacking.  A generous 2 star as 2.5 would be more accurate. Much better dining options in Vegas I'd pass on a repeat here. Fountain show good though go have a drink catch the show then eat elsewhere."
"1","I'm not sure what the hype is about. Having experienced the Gourmet Burger craze in both LA and Dallas maybe my expectations are just too high. Their \""Gold Standard\"" burger has been touted as the best in Vegas... this has to be a joke. The mix of flavors were not balanced well. The goat cheese did not compliment the beef in any way. The ingredients were of good quality but not what I would expect for the price point. \n\nIn general I would say everything on the menu was quite overpriced (even by Vegas standards). This is where Holsteins really fell short for me. I've had $10 burgers that blow this one away. Not to be super whiny but on top of the food not meeting my expectations  the service was a bit slow and my burger was slightly overcooked. Nothing egregious, but I would feel remiss to not point it out here. We tried the Lobster Mac & Cheese appetizer to start and I can't help but compare it to the Lobster Mac at The Capital Grille which is of better quality, a larger portion and actually cheaper than Holsteins. Even the steak fries were uninspired and blah. \n\nOverall I was disappointed at every turn by this place. The food was acceptable and I won't say it was a bad meal but it does not live up to the bar they have set for themselves. I would not go back. Save your money and go to one of the many other great restaurants in Las Vegas."
"1","The food at Matt's is quite good. My issue is with the service. I'm gluten-intolerant and so I asked for my breakfast that normally comes with potatoes and toast to have extra potatoes instead of toast. I was taken aback when the server said no substitutions were allowed, not even for food sensitivities. I understand that a small restaurant that wants to turn tables quickly may not allow substitutions for any reason, but then they should clearly state that on the menu. I probably won't be back."
"2","At one point while at Bacchanal, sometime after eating a plate overflowing with at least a pound of crab legs and before taking on a final slice of cheesecake (one of the 5 desserts I ravaged), it dawned on me:\n\n\""Oh god. I'm like one of the citizens of the Capital in the Hunger Games. What have I become?!\""\n\nI quickly parried that thought however; as much as I want to imagine myself in the vein of a half-starved (and ruggedly handsome) hero of District 12, sometimes...it's nice to indulge. \n\nAnd at Bacchanal, indulge you will. \n\nFrom the get-go, you know you are going to try to cram as much food as humanly possible into your stomach to try and \""claw back'\"" some of the steep entry price (~50$). As a long distance runner with seemingly hollow legs who burns thousands of calories a workout, I think I ended up okay at Bacchanal, maybe eating $30 or so dollars worth of food at its retail price. I can live with that. \n\nBeyond calculations of value (which are almost meaningless in Vegas, which seems to be fueled on the wispy fumes of luxury itself), the fare is par for the course. Everything I ate was of high quality and tasty. \n\nOne thing I didn't like so much was the blaring Euro-hip music. I think they blast it so you'll eat and leave more quickly, but...it was annoying not to be able to have conversations with the people I went with. \n\nSome things had an extra fine-tuned and endearing touch though, like the fish and chips in little metal frying crates or the Chinese dumplings in individual bamboo baskets (or maybe I'm easily impressed). \n\nEither way, those small details made the experience more than just a ridiculous gut-stuffing smorgasbord."
"1","Long ass line. $32.88 for lunch buffet. The cashier was a bitch...attitude up the wazuu. The hostess was nice, our waiter server Eric was awesome (Sweetest Guy ever). \n\nThe food (vegetarian pov): was disappointing.\n\n1) Breakfast: breads were cold and stale. Oatmeal was cold, they make fresh omelet but the station is towards the back away from the rest of the brkfst items...(all breakfast items should be grouped together, pastas together, seafood together etc....).\n\n2) Sushi: rice was old and really cold...not fresh, sloppy cutting, sloppy display; wasabi was pasty like ketchup. \n\n3) Dessert: cheesecake was moist but at times not available, because they didn't re-fill the countertops fast enough.\n\nI give this place a. NEGATIVE 1 STAR.\n\nOverall this was a disappointing experience because of the lack of freshness, lack of elegance, lack of everything for the price tag. \nBellagio buffet is not worth the price, even if you eat meat. \n\nBetter off going to the Sugar factory across the street...pay less and get 100% better food...that is fresher!"
"1","The food wasn't bad (Chix fried rice & pork gyoza). They charged me for a large rice for take out  and only got a small, at least I hope it wasn't the large!  I think there might be a bit of a communication issue here. Also, Japanese or Chinese but not both please."
"2","Yes, I went there because of Bar Rescue. Beer was good, selection was great. The Stout was tasty. Bartender was friendly, attentive. Comp'ed the first round because I through a 20 into the poker machine. More women than men hanging out there.\n\nAll in all a nice, clean place to grab a drink and get away from the over the top vegas life and get more local."
"1","Laser quest is a fun experience for kids of all ages, but the adults that play at this establishment, honestly kind of creep me out.  The best time to bring your children here is during the middle of the week, because there is always an abundance of birthday parties on the weekend, and it can take hours before you are able to participate.  Each game is about fifteen minutes long and the setup is fairly large, with many areas to run around and attack friends.  Bring your childhood self here for a good clean time!"
"1","If you like staying at the slums and love horrible customer service, I would recommend this place.  Talk about a waste of money. \n\nFrom the time that you call and reserve your hotel, the phone CSRs sound like they don't want to be at their job......Seriously.  They sound unmotivated.  Their attitude is \""\""next..\"""
"1","Stopped in to this place which lives lives in two small buildings for lunch today, joined by Robyn N. & Mike C.  Mike & I split a \""Pig Mac\"" & a \""Python Ripper\"".\n\nThe Pig Mac was a burger with 1/4 lb. of hamburger plus 1/4 lb. of pork sausage, plus lettuce, pickle, carmelized onion, & sauce.  It tasted good, but I liked it less than a similar sized burger at Smashburger, Five Guys or Fatburger.  ($7.25)\n\nThe Python hot dog ($8.75) was plain, but for the mustard you add yourself, & had a tasty but skinny snake weiner in it.  Ok, not just his weiner.     :-))\n\nSeating was uncomfortable to me, sitting on a high, hard stool at a high table.\n\nService was friendly & prompt.\n\nBy the time it was over this cost just under $19, & both Mike & I were still hungry when we left, so even though the snake dog was an interesting treat this was a pretty weak experience overall & it's not a place I would return to."
"1","Everything is awesome except the food.\n\nInteresting menu, nice staff, fun concept, but aside from the beignets(which are only passable as something other than beignets) - the food is somewhere between subpar and plain ol terrible.\n\nOrdered a burrito, a quesadilla, some nacho-tots, and the beignets so felt like we tried it all.  There were 2 issues with every single thing we ordered.\n\n1) the ingredients weren't very good (Kinda like someone emptied out microwave burritos instead of making rice, meat, veggies, etc...)\n\n2) The food is poorly prepared.  The kids that work there are very nice but they put so much buffalo sauce on the quesadilla that it was inedible, and the burrito was layered like a parfait so that each bite was a single but different ingredient.\n\nMight try again some day but doubt it."
"1","I cannot begin to imagine how this dump stays open. The food is as poorly done as any nameless food joint in a mall, prices are high, and the service is mediocre. The fact they are close to my home means we've been 3-4 times, and every time we regret it (and, evidently, never learn). I've tried to do a phone-in take out twice: both times they quoted 15 minutes, took closer to 45 minutes, and then screwed up my order which cost another 20. I suspect tonight's fiasco (ordered at 5:45, was told 15 minutes, picked up my order at 6:30, then had to go back because they screwed it up again) will be the last."
"1","I felt that the doctor, Joe Sharkus, did not explain very much to me. He spoke in esoteric terms and left the room immediately after procedures asking the assistant to explain procedures and process for him. Worst yet, I was originally quoted at 600 dollars which seemed right considering my insurance but after the procedure, mouth numb, they handed me a bill for 1100 dollars.  They had little explanation for why the bill changed so drastically. The receptionist said something like, \""looks like your plan was downgraded.\"" Later I found out through my insurance company that that was simply not true. I had not been downgraded just misled. They originally quoted me for one kind of filling my insurance took but then filled my mouth with a different kind my insurance did not take. It all was perfectly legal and in the tiny fine print but I think completely unethical. I can't afford those kinds of bills so I have had to go through a 3rd party payment plan to pay it off. I would not recommend him or that office."
"1","This location is a glorified garage sale. It smells and nobody speaks English. Children are running free pulling clothes off racks and smashing into people. \n\nIf you are lucky, you can find shoes, but I have never found jack shit for clothes.\n\nGo upstairs to Marshall's and spare yourself."
"1","I really hate to give this place two stars, but our to-go order had so many mistakes and poor execution that I had to post. Pluses included tamale, flautas and sides. The server who helped us was great, but then I opened the food at home. Fajitas were wrong order( ordered double beef and got single beef/ chicken )and had lots of gristle/connective tissue. Most dishes were mushy due to lettuce next to/ under them and grease/ fat. Shrimp with chipotle was overwhelmingly spicy and strong with lots of grease. Ordered sopapillas which were missing. Perhaps things are better when you order in restaurant, but they really need to improve to-go quality and execution."
"1","I've had better buffets at Sizzler.  Long lines, stale food and just a very dirty apperance. This used to be the spot to eat if you wanted a buffet experience. Garbage!!!!"
"1","I've only had one pizza here.  I ordered the Margherita for delivery on a Friday night...I wished and I do mean REALLY WISHED I didn't that night.  I was famished and was looking forward to a slice of heaven based on the \""wonderful\"" reviews Ian's Pizza has on Yelp, but holy f*uck was it a disaster it turned out to be!!!  Sauce clumsily spread on, mozzarella not even melted, and whole leaves of basil just tossed on without a damn care on the pizza.  There is no way for me to soften the blow to write this review... the pizza I had was an embarrassment to all pizzas ever made."
"1","Manager is the worst I have ever seen for customer service. He DOES NOT CARE what you think or need. Do Not buy at this location, and be very wary at any Sears Outlet store as I found out after talking to Sears Corp customer complaint office that Outlets operate under \""Different\"" rules and polices than the rest of the Sears stores.  Translation - Outlet managers should be looked at like used car salesmen, they will tell you anything until the sale is final then you play hell getting anything from them.!"
"1","Tried this place for lunch, had the chicken burro and have to agree with the other reviewers. I wouldn't recommend Matador and am still baffled that it was packed at lunchtime."
"1","The food from here is outstanding! I ordered a pizza from here tonight and was told it would take 20 minutes, I left my house 15 minutes later and upon arriving at the store I was told my order would be ready in 15 minutes (probably had not even been put in the oven yet). After waiting 25 more minutes I was told my order would be ready in 2 minutes. The lobby was full of people waiting on their orders too, one woman got there ahead of me and was still waiting when I left. Another customer had asked if a military discount was available and was told no, it's hard to believe that in the state of affairs the world is in some businesses still do not recognize the contributions our military has made to our well being."
"2","I have lived in this area forever and can recall when this little place opened.  It was exciting to have a restaurant in the area.  After all these years I can say I still feel that same enthusiasm.\n\nPros:  The food overall is tasty and the menu is much better from what it had been in the past in my opinion.  Prices are rather reasonable even off happy hour.  Service has always been good.  This is an area that can be tricky since it seems the bartender is also in charge of waiting on the tables in the restaurant.\n\nCons:  The only real con is that this is clearly a bar that has tables for customers who may want to eat,  Originally there was a separation between the bar and the restaurant.  I do not necessarily mind this, but I could see some turned off by it.  \n\nI definitely plan on hitting up this spot more often. especially when the NFL comes back."
"2","From my prior tip, yes, we had a big fat Greek lunch here yesterday, and it was GREAT!  This is epic so brace yourselves.  \n\nThis is the only BFGR location I've visited and we always have a great time.  I've taken Mr. M, I've taken a group of girlfriends, I've taken a group of coworkers and they've never let us down. \n\nI'm still thinking about yesterday's lunch so that's what I'm going to write about.  We sat at the bar and each ordered a glass of retsina.  It took awhile for the wine to make its way to us.  Our server was very nice, but at one point she stopped by with two wine glasses and said, \""I'll have so and so make your sangria because he does a better job.\""  I politely reminded her we had ordered 2 glasses of retsina, and she gave me kind of a blank look and said, \""Oh, I don't know if we carry that anymore.\""  Uh....we had ordered it about 12 minutes and 47 seconds ago....\n\nI happened to glance over at the wine/beer cooler and saw a yellow label that looked like it had Greek writing on it.  I asked her if that was it, and sheepishly, she said \""Yes\"", and immediately poured us two healthy glasses of that wonderful wine.  \n\nAh.  I'm happy.\n\nMr. M was Jonesin' for a gyro so that's what he ordered with the Greek fries.\n\nI ordered one kebab of chicken souvlaki and one of the beef souvlaki with the Greek potatoes and a Greek side salad.  \n\nEverything was delicious.  We were passing the gyro back and forth.  It was overstuffed and had all the right flavors and plenty of gyro meat stuffed in that soft pita.  And the Greek fries....don't get me started.  Those are ridiculous with the feta cheese, seasoning, and sauce they drizzle over those.  I don't know what it is, but we OD'd on those for sure.\n\nMy kebabs had a wonderful smoky, grilled flavor, the chicken was tender and the steak was cooked a perfect med rare.  My roasted potatoes were nice and tender and I proceeded to stuff myself with even more potatoes.  Roasted taters + Greek fries = carbo overload.  My plate also came with some nice saut\u00e9ed veggies, squash, broccoli, carrots, onion.  Very tasty.\n\nThe salad that started the meal was crisp and full of wonderful Greek flavor as well.  \n\nAll in all we quite happily made complete pigs out of ourselves.  Everything was delicious, and after the slow start with the service, it was great after that, and a couple of other manager/owner types checked on us too.  I love that.\n\nThen....oh yes there's more....we had just pushed back our chairs, were rubbing our full bellies, and here comes another owner/manager type offering us a sample of the new type of roasted potato they are going to offer.  \n\nOh Lordy.  I am wondering what kind of carb coma I'm going to end up in, but we tried them and they were delicious.  They created a sauce that blends the best of oregano, lemon, and I think white wine and I even think I spied a caper.  Wonderful.  \n\nI want to go back today."
"1","I used to really like it here, but now everytime I go I end up dissapointed. Its really not that good and so overpriced. I do love the decor and the family dinning they support it allows you to really spend time with the people you came with."
"2","John's has a huge variety and a cool atmosphere. I can't wait for the warmer weather so I can sit outside on their deck! My personal favorite is the tuna tataki! Yum! The owner, John, is super personable. He always makes sure we have a great experience!"
"1","Very pricey...at least compared to normal yogurt places such as Yogurtland. The yogurt itself is very creamy...together. It's actually a bit too creamy for me as I wanted a more yogurt-y feel rather than eating the many gelato places all over the strip. Anyway, this is what I tried:\n\nCheesecake: Definitely reminds me of a sour cream/cream cheese mix, but VERY, very creamy.\n\nTart: I honestly thought you couldn't go too wrong with plain tart, but it was creamy and way too sour. There was really no flavor to it; just creamy sourness...if that's even a flavor.\n\nChocolate: Again, a bit of a disappointment. It did taste better than most of the other yogurts, but it wasn't too satisfying. I guess it's one of those \""I'll eat it if I have to since I'm craving CHOCOLATE AND I NEED IT NOW!!!\"" last resorts.\n\nPistachio: Absolutely no flavor. Just a sweet icy thing. Hideous.\n\nStrawberry: This one was my favorite. It was pretty much the only edible thing there...actually tasted like strawberries and cream. Again, not the best by far, but certainly edible.\n\nOverall, I am definitely still on my search to find a decent yogurt place in Vegas..."
"2","I've been going to Nevada Trails for a few years now and I have nothing but good things to say. Dr. Brian and his staff are courteous and very professional. You won't be disappointed!"
"2","Large rooms, comfortable beds, great in hotel location. For Marriott elite members, they also have a very nice club room with good food."
"1","Getting Run Down and Smells!   Have gone to this 131 Main since it opened and have loved it for years.  As with any restaurant, hotel or business, at some point things need to be renovated.   Time to put some of all that money we spent back into the freshening up the restaurant.   It smells and tables, seats and restaurant in general showing its age.   The table we sat at last month was pealing all over the top and was  scratched up.   VERY DARK LIGHTING CAN'T COVER IT UP ANY LONGER!   I was embarrassed as we brought 2 couples who commented on it.    Also, with changes in management we had the worst service (first time we had bad service there in 8 years) we've ever had.   \n\nGet your act together 131 Main!  Don't rest on past success and renovate for the future!!!"
"1","Spent my 40th birthday stay (Sept. 2012) at TI and had a decent time though I've had more fun at other resorts. TI's rooms are spacious and clean and their housekeeping was top notch. I had zero issues with the room my entire 6-day stay there. Buffet was ordinary but I did like some of the drink choices at the various bars. There's a really good pizza place near Mysterie Theatre but it closes early which makes no sense being that it's Vegas. 99% of my late-night eating was done at other resorts. Casino was ok. Won $50 at blackjack one day, lost it the next. I was there the opening weekend of the college football season so there seemed to be a lot of UNLV fans there, which was cool. They were all fun people. I did not see Mysterie but instead went across the street to see La Reve at The Wynn. The underlying theme of my birthday stay at TI was that most of my adventures were done elsewhere. The Syrens show was interesting the first time then got tiring every time you walk by it for a week. I'd probably stay there again ONLY if I got a discounted room which I got from the booking agent because it was my birthday."
"1","Pros:\n\nEasy in & out\nGood parking\nWas able to request late check out \n\nService review:\nUpon returning to my room we discovered a bug problem in our room. Front desk stated they would give us a call back. 15 minutes later we received a call that they found us another room & a new key would be sent up to our room. 20 minutes later a key arrives. We take our luggage to the new room & discover the key doesn't work. Since things take 15-20 minutes to fix I walked to get a room key that worked. I was really upset since it was 3 am. Seeing the big (what appeared to be roaches) in the room really freaked me out. So I didn't get a good nights sleep. If they were in 1 room I'm sure they were in several.\n\nThe next day I checked my Marriott Rewards Account as well as my banking account. The hotel had taken a free night reward as well as used points as well as charged 2 different credit cards incidentals for the 1 night stay. I was floored. I attempted to call the front desk, but was transferred to the hotel directors voicemail. Eventually I called Marriott customer service to air out my grievances. \n\nI probably will not stay and would not recommend this hotel for anyone coming into down. There are a ton of hotels on the strip. Since I am a marriott rewards credit card and member I wanted to stay true to the brand. I will not do that again when traveling to vegas."
"1","How to reenact the Fremont Experience in your hotel room:\n\nMaterials: \n1. Flashlight \n2. Hands, preferably yours and attached to body \n3. Comforter cover or just a dark room\n4. Computer screen saver (preferred)\n\nDirections:\n1. Turn off lights or cover yourself with comforter \n2. Turn on flashlight\n3. Make shadow puppets \n4. Skip 2 and 3 if using screen saver (preferred) \n5. Make some kind of sound effect when you do the (puppet) show\n\nUnless you're already on Fremont St., don't make the extra trip here. Also, the Fremont Hotel doesn't have self parking, only valet."
"1","This place was really busy when we arrived so it seemed promising. Some of the food was good and others were sub-par.\n\nTwo of us ate the gyro platter which comes with: \nhummus (watery) \npita (store bought) \ngyro meat (I've never had gyro meat like this before, it was ultra thin and had a rubbery texture - also the portion was so small) \nGreek salad (iceberg with sparse toppings and too much dressing) \ngrape leaves (vegetarian but quite good) \nand rice (actually this was the tastiest thing on the platter - it had a nice lemon and chicken broth flavor). \n\nOverall the food was hit or miss. The most disappointing were the pita and the gyro meat. My companion had the salmon and said it was unremarkable. I think diners come for the cake which was eaten by almost every person in the joint. \n\nI also have to agree with some of the other reviewers, this place is disgustingly dirty. All patrons walk through the kitchen to use the bathroom which was really gross. The kitchen was not clean and our waiter had food on his hands when he served us. \n\nEven homemade wine and honey soaked cake won't bring me back again."
"1","Not great.  Was hoping to like this place since they appear to have great happy hour deals and a good environment for catching games on TV, but our food came out cold and bland.  At least it's another chain that I can cross off of my \""chains I've never been to\"" list."
"2","I like this place. It's clean and big, and always has a ton of staff. They are incredibly friendly and do fast, great work. Prices are incredibly reasonable. Plus they always accommodate you to make sure you can get in, even as a walk-in customer. They'll even stay late to make sure you get taken care of."
"2","Asian food is not usually my first choice.. ever. But Clever Koi really surprised me! \nI enjoyed the restaurant itself, from the ambiance to the service, everything was impeccable. \nWe came to try the drinks that we hear such rave reviews about so we weren't initially planning to order any food. The bar was full so we were seated at a table and asked our waitress for an appetizer suggestion. She lead us to choose the Chinese long beans, which I never would have picked on my own, and they were fabulous! Did I mention they come with duck tongue? It sounded weird to me at first but it was seriously delicious. We also decided to try the steamed buns; the lamb pastrami and onion ring were so flavorful. Oh, and the onion ring bun came with a sriracha sauce that made my night because I love spicy anything.\nThe drinks we ordered were the best drinks I think I've ever had. I tried the enabler and my friend ordered the reviver. Needless to say both of our drinks were so good we each had to have two. We could see the bartender actually making the drinks and taking his time crafting them, which I thought was a unique added touch. \n\nMy only complaint is that I live in Tucson and wish it was closer so I could branch out more often. Here's hoping they open a location in Tucson!"
"1","This place went from being a half way decent bus station (Lockers, Semi-clean restrooms, Vending machines, and good Security) to something of a hassle and a nightmare. The new Security Guard company set up is a joke. The police were here when I arrived, during my stay when I went DT for lunch, and during my departure. Wow. Not deterring anything. They also do a half a** job searching bags upon entry, easily missing people coming and going and being less than on top of anything. The station greyhound clerks went from being understaffed to overstaffed and yet they remain unfriendly and the lines are no shorter. All in all, this place is going down hill fast."
"1","The worst ran business in Las Vegas. I needed a scratch on a bumper to be buffed and painted. The man said 1 day....well four days later they are still not done. Here's the best part. They claim to have a \""loaner\"" car. The car wouldn't even kick into gear and is a danger to drive, not only to the driver but the general public. I arrive on the 4th day to pick up the car they said it's still not done and to come back in 30-45 minutes. No call ahead to let me know that it would be a longer wait. Oh yea they only take cash and don't tell you until your car is already in their position. They will charge you just as much as a legit body ran properly so don't waist your time."
"2","I thought this place was kind of hard to find as most places on Sahara are for some reason. I went here specifically to buy some Vatika Oil for my hair. The product itself was not hard to find at all since all of the hair products are literally the aisle right behind the register when you walk into the store. They're always fully stocked and the clerks are nice. Rani's was my first visit to an international food market so I was a little nervous that nobody would speak English for some reason (perhaps an ignorant assumption), but I've had good experiences here. I thought that Las Vegas would not have an international food market and I would have to go online to buy my Vatika oil but I did not. I'm very pleased. I would call this a hidden gem. Probably not as big as some stores you'd find in NYC but I don't think that would be a fair comparison."
"2","Went late night and was the only table in the place, good service the duck was very good tender with crispy skin and also pan friend noodles with beef were good too. Would go back again."
"2","I really loved the professional level of service that I received from Francesca. She was extremely knowledgeable about the product and it made me feel more confident in my decision. I felt as if I was getting quality service and was extremely pleased with my entire visit to see Francesca. I would definitely return again!!"
"1","This place kind of sucks. The waitress was super nice but the food is awful and the drinks are very overpriced. I'm happy we went because I was always curious about the place but we definitely won't be returning."
"2","I needed to get an emissions test for my car so that I could register it back home. My boyfriend told me to go here since this is where he went. \n\nThey have several locations on their website, not all of them have Yelp listings so I would recommend taking a look at it to see if there's one closer to where you live or want to go. You can also see how busy each one is too and the expected wait time.\n\nI went on a Saturday afternoon and there were 3 lanes open with a few cars in each line. The time went by quickly. I was in and out in about 10 minutes and it costed $27.75. Very efficient and a pain free process."
"1","The food was 3 out of 5 stars but the price was right. Lots of flat screens which was nice. Our food came out fast except we had to wait nearly 25 minutes for the cookie skillet desert. If that's usual then it would of been nice to have been told it would take that long. That's excessively long in my opinion and the reason why I won't be taking my family back. Also, it says it's kid friendly but there were no kids meals listed in the menu. The waitress apologized and read them aloud to us. It would of been nice to have it on the menu."
"1","Went for dinner tonight at the restaurant, usually just get delivery which is ok... I will probably not eat here again and stick with  delivery. The pizza took forever and was undercooked, no crunch to it. We asked for pineapples and they put so many on it was just overwhelming. Also the bathrooms are just gross, looked like they hadn't been cleaned, ever. I was pretty bummed about the whole experience, what a waste of calories."
"1","Truffle fries, gourmet burgers, hints of Asian fusion here and there, and food served on plates with four corners.  This is enough to make some people thrilled about a restaurant already.  However, when everybody else seems to be doing the the same thing, each one needs to stand out in some way.  Rusconi's didn't.\n\nTHE GIST: Modern American menu / Inconsistent seasoning / Service needs work\n\nFOOD HIGHLIGHTS\n\nGoat Cheese Fondue with Pita Bread: The fondue was good, the pita bread used to dip it was not.  Our first batch had lukewarm pita bread that had a chewy, dare-I-say microwaved consistency.  After our table finished the first round of pita bread, they were kind enough to offer a second; this batch came out burnt, but this time with a sitting-on-the-counter-too-long consistency.\n\nCheeseburger with Fries: Several members of my party ordered this one, one of them asking for no salt on the fries.  Everybody else got crunchy, but very salty fries.  Her order seemed to have a batch of unsalted fries sitting atop a batch of salted fries, because there was definitely salt at the bottom of her bowl.  The burger itself was unremarkable.\n\nOssobuco: This was the special for the night.  Unlike the fries, it was incredibly under-seasoned and rather dry.  I got it to taste a bit better with some salt, but dry ossobuco is pretty hard to get through as is.  Not recommended.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIt's trendy, it's big, and it's American, but there are too many places pulling this concept off correctly for me to recommend this to anyone."
"2","Our driver got us to the airport safely in an ice storm.  Wouldn't have made it without him.  Thanks Michael!  We will use again and again!"
"1","We were in Las Vegas one week ago, We purchased a one day ticket for $12 each because we were wanting to get from the Wynn area down to the Luxor to pickup tickets for the show that night.  We had to walk from the Wynn down to the nearest station (that we were told was) at the Imperial Place......OMG what a long walk in 113 degree temperature.  Then the walk through the casino to get to the station.  We just missed the monorail so had to wait for the next one.....the platform is hot!  The monorail itself is beautiful, smooth, fast....perfect.  We got off at MGM (the last stop) and walked and walked and walked again.  After picking up our tickets we wanted to go back to the Wynn for the afternoon and decided to take a taxi instead of the monorail.  The taxi driver explained that the original idea was to put the monorail right down the middle of the strip but the taxi and shuttle services complained....therefore it ended up behind the hotels.  Really that is too bad because we will never use it again and it seems like it is a huge waste of money."
"2","Pretty much the bread and butter date night or sweet tooth du jour of NoDa. You really can't go wrong at Crepe Cellar. \n\nThe crepes are made with buckwheat, so you may be in for a bit of a surprise at first bite. A a little more chewy, earthy, and malty than your mom's crepes. Definitely better for the savory variety. \n\nOne of the strengths of Crepe Cellar is their offering of savory and sweet crepes. You definitely need to try the Queen City savory. Wonderful flavors. Can't believe how much it made me love chicken, mushrooms and spinach together. Who knew all it took was a buckwheat crepe? The oven-roasted tomato dressing goes good on ANYTHING. Definitely the center stage act of this dish. \n\nWhen it comes to sweet, just try anything. You won't be unhappy. Especially with a piping hot brownie, ice cream and accompanying a warm, fresh crepe. Come on, America. France is right on this one. \n\nLastly, alcohol. I love that they have so many good beers. Both both bottle and draught. Lots to choose from. Or, if you're a redneck like me, PBR is pretty cheap here. Hell yes. If you're of the classier alcohol mantra, definitely go for the Cellar Cider. Wonderful little concoction. Baron Jager and a few other spirits. Definitely worth the dough. \n\nLimited seating here, folks. Make sure you get here at a decent hour or put your name in and walk the streets of NoDa. Typically an hour wait or so on busy nights. \n\nYou'll be pleased with your visit. Bar none. One of the staples in the Queen City."
"2","We stopped in here for a late lunch after touring the Capitol.  They had a 51 beers on tap (!!) and close to 100 in bottles.  We tried a local beer and ordered some grub.  The food (salad for me), was fine but nothing special.  The location of the restaurant and all the beers on tap (along with the ambience) definitely makes up for the food."
"2","Right around the corner from Renaissance Hotel. Excellent coffee and tasty bagels and pastries. Other food (breakfast sandwich, paninis), but didn't try. Attractive decor that invites hanging around."
"1","Lookin for good food after a movie at Epicenter on a Sunday night.\n\nThe wings were meaty and tasty. Bigger than average. I got an order of 16 and could only eat 10 with a side salad. Got 2 flavors. Lime and garlic. Both were good.\n\nService at the bar was poor. Had 2 servers and was very slow. I had to ask for refills and service.\n\nDessert was terrible. I had brownie alamode. The ice cream was crystallized ice milk. Horrible.\n\nWould not return/("
"2","Finally an authentic taco shop in AZ!!! Reminds me of home sweet home (chicago). All the staples are there...2 corn tortillas, cabbage, red salsa, limes....they even have ground beef...A rarity in these parts. Couldn't be happier :D"
"1","Located in The Linq on the Las Vegas Strip. To be honest I like the Town Square location better and here is why; I had a coupon that had expired they would not take it, but they took it at the Town Square location. It would have been no big deal for the manager to take it, so I will not be going back to this location. life is too short for bad customer service. Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"
"2","love this store,  im currently expecting and already purchased my babies bassinet,  crib with mattress and changing station for $250.  Maternity clothes is also very cute and affordable"
"1","Their new pastry line is gross! Now that Starbucks has decided to get all political on us with their anti-second amendment position, we are not going back."
"2","My husband and I just saw the show in Las Vegas end of April 2008, It was my first time seeing David and I was excited even though I read some negative reviews. I have to say that I really enjoyed myself. We were in row 2A which is really row 1 and touching the stage. I was approached as soon as I sat in my seat to be on stage to help!! For the 2nd illusion my husband and I were brought up on stage to help confirm that a steel plate was in fact, real. We were instructed to really cheer for David as he likes that, LOL. I was amazed by things that he did and how he did them and would recommend others to see this show. I have read lots of reviews that were accurate also. He does take his time to find the pretty ladies in the audience to participate. My husband called that one!  Other than the few of the hot ladies chosen, all other people that participated were selected at random using frisbees or big silver balls. I think my seat being so close to the stage really may not be a benefit to \""seeing the whole picture\"" and I did see some of the \""tricks\"" if you know what I mean. Not sure if that was DAvid and his gang being sloppy or my angle from the stage. All in all, I would see it again and he kept the audience laughing also. I didn't see anyone leaving disappointed."
"1","I am so incredibly disappointed in the assistance I have received from Phoenix College. I am a first-time college student who also works full time. I enrolled in 3 classes to start easily. I have had an issue with one of my online classes for a MONTH now. Advisors have been unhelpful to say the least. They do nothing but tell me to contact the instructor, which I have tried to do several times to no avail. So I ask and advisor again, and they tell me to contact the instructor's department head. \n\nSure, that would be great, except the class begun YESTERDAY and I STILL have no gotten any answers or help regarding the issue. \n\nI would not recommend this college based on the experience I've had. I've spoken to many people who are currently enrolled in other schools, and they have been blown away by the general unavailability and apparent ambivalence of the advisors to help me with my issues."
"1","I really enjoyed Crema Caf\u00e9 before they expanded; I even told friends they had the BEST breakfast. Unfortunately after expanding, the food and customer service has gone downhill. While dining there this morning I tasted my side salad and it was SALTY. I don't understand why they started adding salt and pepper to their delightfully simple side salad, it's BAD. When I asked a staff member if the added salt to the salad she said no, but we heard the cook in the background correct her. The breakfast sandwich was ok but definitely not worth $9 with the salty side salad that is inedible. The last time we visited, the food was really bad too. I LOVE the killer scramble (scrambled eggs, goat cheese, and smoked salmon). The salmon must have been expired because it smelled and tasted awful. With some quality control and improved service this restraint could be great again."
"1","Disappointing. \nService (just the server) was middle of the road to poor. Expected a lot more from a Thomas Keller place. \nOysters were good. Server forgot oyster forks and a bowl. Brought them after we asked. \nPate was off the charts good. \nFoie gras was bland. Some of the worst I've ever had. Wtf? Tasteless and like refrigerated lard. Lacked the wonderful textures and nuanced flavor that good foie gras has. Sigh.\n\nMy friend's fish was on the bland side. Or uninspired. Lacking something. My pork short ribs were really tasty, but both of our entrees were on the just barely warm side. More Wtf. \nDessert order was taken. Server returned to explain they were out of the one my friend ordered. Ok. I know it happens. Just added to the sense that the server wasn't paying attention. Dessert was dropped and table hadn't been marked (no silverware).  Another server noticed and brought us silverware.\n\nThe back server (or busboy if you must call him that, though you ought not to) however: Amazing. This guy was on top of everything he could be expected to be from start to finish. HE was what we expected from the place. Changed plates, checked on us (when the server was off schmoozing the table of hot ladies next to us (yeah, I get it, they're hot and we're just a couple of guys, but we're ordering well and aren't you just the least bit aware of the difference in service you're providing our two tables when we're right next to each other and we can SEE it??).... oh wait, I was talking about how great the back server was... Right. He was great. Crumbed. Refilled. Fast. Expedient. Made us feel at the least... cared about? Noticed? Something like that.\n\nLower than average overall experience.\n\nPalmed the back server cash on the way out. 20% to the server because you do. And sadly, wouldn't  go back."
"2","I just ate here with my husband and my in-laws and it was hands down the BEST fried chicken I have EVER had! Super crispy and tasty on the outside and yummy and juicy on the inside. And we got 8 BIG pieces of chicken and 2 slices of cornbread for $10.99- such a deal! The owners were so kind and welcoming and we enjoyed visiting with them. The collared greens were perfect- nice and crisp- and the sweet potato pie was delish. I am HIGHLY recommending Ezekiel's to anyone who will listen to me. We'll be back."
"2","I called 2 companies, The first company came out with a \""pricing on the fly\"" model. They pushed purchasing a new unit and gave me a quote of about 1200 dollars and said they didn't have all the parts and that it may be worse if they find other problems. I paid the 79 dollar diagnostic and called One Hour. The guy showed up on time and had all of the parts. His price was about $400 less and they had all the pricing preprinted and defined. Here is why I gave them 5 stars. The tech accidentally fried my thermostat. We didn't notice till later when we figured out the unit wasn't shutting off. They sent someone out the next day and made it right. That is a critical piece. When something unexpected goes wrong (as it does from time to time), a good company will make it right. These guys made it right."
"2","Hot damn!! Really good BBQ!! Get in there!! Brisket was too good!! Love that Mac n cheese too!! Off the strip, but sooo fricken good!!! Well worth the trip!!!\nGoing back for more the 2nd night"
"1","Ugh this place is so overrated! It's cool that they cook in front of you and everything but the quality of the food is not great!!! I've been here twice for friends birthday dinners and I don't know why they like it here so much. The service is awful and everything is so overpriced!!! If I never go here again I would be fine with it but I bet one of my girlfriends will drag me here again"
"2","Great place for Sunday brunch. Blood Mary's very good."
"2","Sorry but there is always a wait here but you'll just have to get over that because this place is so frikin delicious! They serve pancakes with ice cream on it!!! Ive tried the cherries jubilee and bananas foster pancakes with the honey wheat pancakes I believe it is and bananas foster definitly better but it depends which you prefer because both were fan frikin tastic.  (im sure only like 5 calories too right??, ha ) And I have also had the eggs benedict with the portabello mushroom on it (don't remember what it was called) I dont eat meat so I get it with out it and with out the other sauce it comes with, but still get the hollandaise and man, its good! It has a little spice to it and I love spice.  The iced green tea is yummy also. The servings are big so you can always order to share (or if you cant decide, order a couple things and  share everything) When the weather is nice, I recommend sitting outside. All in all, love this place!"
"2","I practically lived here during my lunch breaks from work. The Bonzai burrito is the best burrito I have ever had. We need a Wahoos to come to the East Side."
"1","Yesterday evening, I came here for dinner and drinks with friends. I enjoyed everything until later last night when I started to feel very sick. All night I had nausea and vomiting due to their tainted food, and their quesadilla was the only thing I ate last night so I know that that had to be the cause. Thanks to their food preparation, I've been feeling miserably sick for almost the past 24 hours. I would not recommend eating here unless whoever prepared my food gets fired and replaced with someone competent and sanitary."
"1","MAC's used to be a favorite place. 3 years ago, we'd have given them a solid 4, but no more.\n\nUnfortunately, we were VERY disappointed with breakfast for a second time. \n\nWent Saturday 10/01 for breakfast and service was just so so, food prep was EXTREMELY slow (nearly 30 minutes from order to table), pancakes were undercooked on 1 side (not even lightly browned), worst coffee we can remember, our check total was incorrect AND our credit card charged for somebody else's order. \n\nThe only enjoyable part was the Bloody Marys \n\nSeems like since they expanded their space they lost touch with the things that made them a great gathering place. \n\nNot going back again for a LONG time and when we do return, it will never be for breakfast as there are dozens of places that offer a far better breakfast value, service and food.\n\nIf you decide to try MAC's we suggest thay you confine your visit to Happy Hour as that seems to be the only time you'll get a good value."
"1","This is one of the smallest J Crew stores I've been to. They do not have men's clothes, and is limited in selection. Also, as mentioned by others, the staff is unfriendly and not helpful; after I was given a fitting room, there was no one available to get me another size in what I had tried on :("
"2","Dr.Judge is amazing! He saves me time to time from painful headaches, and he is the first person I went to see when I threw my back out. There is no sales pitch, no bs... He is good at what he does and can relieve pain instantly. I sent a couple people there, and they were really grateful!\nPricing is good and walk in whenever you want. Membership is a no brainer!"
"1","I went with my parents while they were in town and we had a bogo coupon from their facebook site.  We started with the mac and cheese sticks and the fried pickles.  Pickles were great!  They were quarter of a pickle, not the pickle chips I was expecting and you get a lot for your money.  The fried mac and cheese was eh.  Both come extremely hot so let them cool down.  The pickles took forever to cool so break them in half.\n\nThe burgers were ok, not the best thing I have ever tasted.  If you dont order one of the \""burgers in the black box\"" (chef designed) you have to pay per extra on your burger.  They charge for lettuce, tomato,  cheese, mayo, etc.  I thought that was not cool.  The sweet potato tots were a great side and I recommend them.\n\nFor dessert we got their famous Cap'n' Crunch milk shake.   it was disgusting.  It tasted like Cap'n crunch that was sitting in milk for a hour."
"2","I went here last night with a party of 7 for dinner.  The place was pretty dead for being around dinner time which was odd yet nice.  The weather was perfect so we sat outside.\n\nI wouldn't mistake this place for a tavern, but I guess it is as close as you can get in the Scottsdale Quarter.  The vibe and decor of the place is pretty cool and I guess it kinda looks like an \""urban\"" tavern.  However their beer selection is pretty weak for a tavern.  The have about 2 dozen or pretty standard brews.\n\nThe food:\n\n* hummus = ok\n* mac n cheese = ok\n* pretzel = excellent.  I really really liked the mustard that came with as well.\n* grilled salmon = pretty good but also pretty standard\n* steak salad thing = This is more steak than salad but it was very good.  The steak strips were cooked perfectly and made a great addition to the salad.  The salad itself was very good and had a very flavorful and complementary dressing.\n* French Fries = excellent!!  Freshly made and perfectly cooked.  LOVE the salt.  HATED the homemade ketchup - it was like marinara sauce mixed with BBQ sauce.  No bueno.\n\nI was expecting crappy service because of what the reviews said on here, but it was actually quite good.  The place was pretty dead so the staff would be hard pressed to NOT be attentive.\n\nAll-in-all it was a pretty good meal and dining experience.  I wouldn't rush back because it isn't really that special of a place, BUT if the other places in the Quarter are too jam-packed; I would return."
"1","I booked this hotel on price line it was rated a 2 star I don't know how? The pictures looked good so I gave it a shot what a nightmare! I booked a nonsmoking king size bed and. And when I got there they said they didn't have any.  So it was late I missed my flight I was tired I noticed the security monitor on the front desk with and cameras ever where. It made me feel it was unsafe. The Indian guy at the counter was nice. So I took the elevator that was very old and missing buttons to the second floor and the second floor was scary no lights only a couple very dim. They had old furniture from other rooms in the hallway! So I finally get to my room and same thing only 2 small lights very dim the ceiling was chipping away carpet has tons of stains and the pillows were a joke. I couldn't sleep because the bugs in the bed were itching me. I checked in at midnight checked out at 6 am went to the airport hours early. I don't get why the Indian hotel owners are so cheap and dirty. The room cost me $70.00 was not worth $20 this place should be a motel. I will never ever stay at a bay mont inn again. Oh I almost forgot the shower smelled like bo (body odor)"
"1","New York - New York was: Stinky, Crowded, Loud, Overpriced and Dirty/Rundown.\n\nStill it was a decent experience but we won't be back because of the above.\n\nSome Redeeming qualities:\nThe Hotel Staff - Hard workers that labor in the above environment.\nLocation - Good part of the strip\nThe Roller-Coaster and Coney Island are neat additions that my kids enjoyed.  \n\nMGM should spend some money and renovate NY NY and not just use it as a cash cow."
"2","A Friend of mine really wanted to come here for dinner so a group of us (guys and girls) decided what the heck.  This place is an awesome sports bar/restaurant as big flat screen TVs were everywhere.  The girls here were no Hawaiian Tropic models, but they weren't bad looking either.  One of them had stuck up attitude and that is a big minus in my book.\n\nNow to the food.  The prices were not too bad, but we didn't know what to expect. I had the Crackling Pork Shank.  It was effin HUGE! I don't care what others may have said, but it was good.  If your Asian, Filipino, Pacific Islander..whatever, you'll like this.  We ordered other dishes which were all good, but this one stood out for me."
"2","They do a great chicken fundido.  And the luncheon chicken fajitas are great also.  At $10.95 the luncheon fajitas are a deal.  A good portion of chicken breast tenders, peppers, tomatoes, and the onions... oh the caramelized onions.  Good chips and salsa.  Always great service.  The only occasional issue is waiting at the front to get seated, this can be frustrating.  But once you're seated, dig in and enjoy.  Its also nice that they send out the monthly BOGO mailer."
"1","This place is horrible in every sense of the word. The \""mechanic\"" that did my oil change... I believe his name was Vega, is rude and not very good at listening. He came out to explain to me what he needed to do since my check engine light was on. He only told me that my oil was 2000 miles over the recommended 3000 mile limit and that the transmission fluid was black and should be flushed. Well he failed to mention that since my car was older and hadn't had regular transmission flushes, that it isn't necessarily a good idea to flush it. But because he wanted to jack up my cost and also get his own money he made it sound like it NEEDED to be done. Shame on me for not doing my research before I let him touch the transmission. Following these services my car began to stall upon coming to a complete stop. At first I was furious because I thought that these \""mechanics\"" had messed up my car completely. Well it was not anything that was directly related to what they did, instead it was due to a large leak in one of my vacuum hoses that they COMPLETELY MISSED. Unless someone physically forces you to go to this place you should avoid it like the plague."
"1","I heard about this restaurant from a friend and thought I would give it a try the other morning. I walked in and was greeted immediately and walked to my table. A gentlemen stopped and asked if I would like some coffee. He brought me the coffee and poured me a cup and left. The coffee tasted bitter and cold and just plain awful. I looked around and waited....and waited...and waited...someone finally stopped and I asked if I could speak to a manager and she said she would send coco? right over. The young lady walked to what i presume was the manager. the lady was texting on her phone and never once looked away from it to even acknowledge the server speaking to her. When she walked away the manager still stood in the corner on her phone for what seemed like forever....i chose to get up and leave because i felt extremely dismissed and won't be back #feelingfrustrated"
"2","Loved it! Went for brunch Sep 2014. Loved the vibe, food, and cheap drinks. I had to indulge my sweet tooth and have the french toast with plaintains. It was amazeballs. My boyfriend had a salad with tuna and he enjoyed it as well. Can't wait to go back."
"2","Great workout! I Great staff. They are very friendly and helpful. I love that it is close to my house and that the hours work with my schedule."
"1","this follow up comment from Jeff Hamra is absolutely not true.  I have had no feedback from Rolex after I offered proof and said I had receipts, emails, etc.  They never told me that this dealer had not sold me two used Rolex's.  I never heard from Rolex and in talking with another Rolex dealer and showing them the serial numbers they confirmed that these were an 11 year old and a 8 year old watch.  I never received updated warranty cards.  I am shocked that a dealer can get away with selling used watches as new - including paying current pricing."
"1","Terrible food the server honestly admitted that the tadig was in his eyes not edible but he still served it to me. I told him this was the worst microwaved tadig from lunch service he agreed apologized and still charged me. What a joke never again will I come to this establishment. How do you serve soggy tadig ??? We were the only table in the restaurant on a Friday night, the atmosphere is like dining in a retirement cafeteria. I feel bad leaving this review but there is not 1 good Persian restaurant in this valley, back to WESTWOOD CA for some awesome Persian food."
"1","So we also went to the soft-opening.  In that, I'm patient with the service issues which were more than present.  Our 4 dinners were brought out one at a time, about 5-10 minutes apart.  I watched as server after server wandered around the room asking \""did you order...?\""\n\nMy biggest issues here were definitely the problems I don't see them resolving with some simple management.\n\n1. I like beer.  I like craft brews and love microbreweries because you can get something completely new.  Not here. I tried every beer they had on tap, except the one they said wasn't ready yet.  The pale ale was decent, but murky and boring. The hefe had a strong vinegar smell, but luckily tasted a little bit better with a strong banana residual flavor.  The James Brown nut ale had the most character, but at the end of the night, was just a nut brown.  The ESB was boring...little flavor and too dark for the style. \nOverall, I enjoyed the guest taps much more.  The Great Divide saison and the Four Peaks black IPA were much more interesting and worth calling craft beers. \n\n2. The food. What a disaster.  I sat with a group of 4.  We ordered their pretzel bread, which I think is just rye bread with pretzel salt on it.  It didn't have much flavor.  The three dips it came with were decent though. I don't eat seafood so the choices for dinner were limited.  There was chicken, burger, bangers and mash, or shepherd's pie.  We ultimately ordered three of these.\n\nWhich all came out about 5-10 minutes apart.\n\nThe chicken was a drumstick and thigh on about 3/4 cup rice.  VERY salty and mostly just a teriyaki taste. The bangers and mash are one sausage on lumpy mashed potatoes. The shepherd's pie was good, all six bites of it. The burger was forgotten about and reordered.  It came out rare, not medium-well as ordered.  It was ok, but I've had much better burgers that didn't cost $14.\n\nOverall, I would eat before you go, and be willing to know that any beer you get here you can get pretty much anywhere else.  Until they get more creative with beers, and reasonable with thier food prices/portions we will not be going again.  \n\nWhat a shame."
"1","I threw up after eating here. Very unpleasant."
"2","Awesome food, awesome service. Probably the best and most consistent food in Mill ave. tons of specials every day. If you haven't come into the Greek since it reopened you need to"
"2","Great to find another tucked away Szechuan restaurant.  All the old classics are here and executed nicely.  Definitely come for family style ordering.  Not everything has to be made spicy and the kitchen will adjust.  The one thing I'm not always used to (mostly because Cantonese people tend to like light flavors) is the amount of oil used.  I just find myself telling the kitchen to go a little lighter on the oil and I've never had a problem."
"1","The dishes here scream \""my first Thai\"" food.  All if their dishes are flavorless bastardized versions of real Thai food. \n\nWhile they do have good and fresh ingredients, all of the 6 entrees we ordered tonight were undercooked and had little to no seasoning. \n\nThere are many other options in the valley that are far superior and hold true to the real quality dishes Thailand has to offer. \n\nI knew something was up when they didn't let me specify how spicy my dish was going to be and just told me they could bring spices out afterwards for me to add to the food. \n\nWell that's one major problem, cooking spices INTO the food is what makes food good. Not just throwing them\nOn top of the dish afterwards. \n\nThe biggest disappointment was the tom yum soup. That is a staple dish that was lacking all of the flavor it's supposed to have. \n\nThere was no ganglia root, lemon grass or\nKamir leaves in the soup at all.  \n\nIt seemed that because they were busy that they had watered down their curry.  Another person at my table ordered the same curry dish as me and it seemed like they made one dish and then watered it down to spread it between both plates. The curry, which is a important dish to get right was not up to par. \n\nThe service wasn't bad but it wast great. Average. \n\nThe one thing that stood out was their meats. They had great quality and well cooked/cut/prepared meats.  But sadly, it seems they are afraid to season their meats as well. \n\nOverall their food is just bland which is not something you'd expect if you've experienced real Thai good. \n\nThis place is \""safe\"" Thai food. If you're afraid to try something ethnic or with unique flavors, this is the place for you."
"2","Came here on a Monday night and place was deserted but the crew in the back was hustling and bustling like it was lunch hour. The cashier Geovani was extremely helpful and polite which you don't see in a teenager this day. I asked him to explain to me what animal style was and he explained it so well to a first timer. Our food was freshly made and tasty but is a bit salty."
"1","I really dislike Menard's.  For every positive interaction I have, I have two negatives ones.  My husband and I just bought a house, so you can imagine how much time we spend here.  I prefer Home Depot but the prices are so much lower at Menard's.\n\nIn the matter of two weeks, all of this happened:\n\n1. I bought a can of paint for our guest room.  I wanted the best paint, with the primer, all the bells and whistles.  I was covering purple.  I needed it.  The salesperson said I could pick from any four.  Yet, he could not tell me why one was rated higher or called premium over the other.  It was weird.  Like here are your options but I can not tell you what their difference really is.  And some were the same brand.\n\n2. When painting the ceiling of said room, we open up a can of paint and notice it has clumps in it.  This paint was about six months old.  Nothing happened to it.  So we go back to Menard's.  We have shopped at several area Menard's, because we are about convenience.  The lady at the counter was SO rude.  We did not have our receipt and could not find it in their system.  We pay for most things in cash and apparently this is NOT a good idea at Menard's.  It had a Menard's sticker which this location does not use (but other locations still use).  \n\nEVERY time we tried to talk to someone she kept speaking over us and saying this can not be from here.  We then had to repeat AGAIN, that we do not just shop at this location.  We shop outside the city sometimes.  We pick things up on our way home.  \n\nAnother rep interceded and offered to return it for us.  She was SO nice.  I wish I remembered all of their names.  But she needed a person from paint to approve it.\n\nBefore looking at the paint, a rep spoke to this RUDE customer service rep and said he could not take the paint back.  It must be our fault and that is that.  Then they said they could not take and dispose of it.  Nice huh?  No one asked us anything.  The paint was BRAND new!  \n\n3. The same day we went to return the paint, we wanted to look at screen doors.  There was no one in the section and you would have thought we were pulling teeth when we did find someone.  He was SO short with us and kept walking away while we still had questions.  It was ridiculous.  \n\nSo the prices keep us going back but the rest?  Awful/Hellish."
"2","If you are looking for a little fun in the sun then head on over to the Putt Park for a round of putt putt. \n\n*Clean facility\n*Pleasant staff\n*Well kept greens\n*Inexpensive \n\nMy boyfriend and I are pretty competitive and we love this place for a little dose of good fun! \n\nAfter you finish your round then head next door to Rambo's Kitchen for $2 off food or a yummy milk shake :)"
"1","I was bringing my family to Cracker Barrow today a group of 6 but after hearing they fired a 73 year old Vet for handing out a Corn muffin I changed my mind...... I hope others feel the same way......"
"2","If you enjoy hot dogs, get to Ted's ASAP!\n\nTed's is a great place to have a charcoal grilled hot dog with all the sides.  There are other items on the menu (sandwiches, burgers), but I've always stuck with the staple hot dog and fries. One day I will try a burger and a milkshake.\n\nHard to beat Ted's classic meal of a hot dog, drink and either fries or onion rings.\n\nThis is a no frills place, good food, good service and old school charm.\n\nThe place can get very busy! Be prepared to wait in line and/or wait for a table to sit.\n\nI'm a bit ashamed that I never wrote a review of Ted's earlier. I thought I had and then realized I never did. Better late than never."
"2","We usually end up here for a late lunch. The menu has changed a little bit, but most of the expensive burgers and salads remain. The beer list is decent but leans towards the mainstream. Once you get over the fact that you just shelled out $15 for a burger with Gruyere and caramelized onions and it didn't even come with fries you'll still enjoy the food.\n\nService varies. I've had great servers, and I've had ones that aren't too swift. But the eye candy is great, and there's sports from every angle. The milkshakes with booze are fun, too."
"1","This State Farm agent and his employees have certainly let me down.\n\nWe started our shopping for insurance on January 3.   After fielding numerous offers, the best price for the coverage we searched for came from State Farm in Scottsdale.  While other State Farm agencies replied as well, Shelbi at this agency knocked everyone else down with her outstanding ($388 for 6 months) price.\n\nI guess I should have started to worry when I received another 'We have a great price for you' email from Shelbi, which felt like she had no awareness it was being sent.   This one quoted the same coverage for $560 for 6 months.   \n\nI replied to the email offering $388.  Over the next 15 days, Shelbi and I emailed back and forth, my providing drivers' license numbers and the VIN number.  As we already have renters coverage under another company, I asked about the price of the policy without the renters coverage, and Shelbi advised we would pay $439.00.  Finally, January 15, Shelbi asked about my payment.  I asked if we could complete everything online or if she required a signature.  She replied that we could complete the transaction online.  I emailed the credit card information.\n\nFor the next 3 days, I was again asked for the credit card information and sent it again and again.  Finally, on the 19th, the date coverage was to commence, I received yet another email requesting my payment information.  Replying again, I got an autoresponse that Shelbi was out of the office through the following Monday.  If I had concerns, I could call the 800 number for State Farm customer care.  \n\n11:30 PM, when I read the email, I came to the realization that I had been driving all day uninsured.  I called the 800 number and asked the representative if I could pay for my insurance with him.  He searched me up in his system and said he found my $560 for 6 months coverage quote.  I asked him to search again, as I was quoted $439.  He tipped and tapped a second and confirmed he found the right quote.  He asked me for a credit card.  I started to provide my American Express number, only to be told that State Farm does not accept American Express.  OK...I got the MasterCard out and gave the number.  \n\nOnce processing was completed, the representative said \""The quote you had has actually gone up a little.  It's $455.86, and you are covered.\""  I asked when I would receive my proof of insurance documents, only to be told \""It will take a couple of days\"".  I asked if something could be sent to me by email, and the representative said \""We don't usually do business that way\"".  I reminded him that I had driven a full day with no insurance, and it would not be acceptable to wait 2 more days to be legal.  He asked his manager, and I received my proof of insurance email a moment later.\n\nI called the office the following morning.  The 'agent', Dusty, was unavailable, as was Shelbi.  I asked for a call back from the agent.  Next, I called Geico.  They got me the same coverage for $51 less in 15 minutes.  After I got my proof of coverage email from Geico, it was time to call and cancel State Farm.  Chris, the representative who answered my phone, wanted to ask questions about why I would cancel my just-purchased coverage.  I replied that I would answer his questions as soon as he cancelled my coverage.  \n\nOnce cancelled, he asked what changed about my satisfaction.  I told him the price changed 3 times, and I drove around for a day uncovered.  He wanted to ask other questions, and I renewed my request for Dusty, the agent, to call me back.  I called at 9:15 AM and did not get a call back from Dusty until 2 PM.\n\nNEVER AGAIN!"
"1","Non-smoking establishment, despite the outdoor bar area. Food is unmemorable, service is fine, plenty of alternatives nearby."
"2","Terrie really made our experience. I love Applebees anyway, but she really treated us like we were the only table she had. \n\nWe walked in at 11:11pm on a Sunday, the place closes at midnight. We were just going to get a quick bite so they could close. Terrie was very friendly and honest about what I should order to get a good deal. I tried the wonton tacos and they were delicious. We also had spinach and artichoke dip, they gave us lots of chips and Terrie helped us box them up with some extra salsa. \n\nNext time I am in Phoenix and want Applebee's, I will go to this location simply because of the service we received."
"2","I've eaten breakfast here twice while staying at TI and haven't been disappointed. You get full and if you add some salt and pepper to your entree it's pretty tasty.  Service was good and the food came quick.  Typical breakfast for 2 including juice or coffee ran about $55 with tip, which is pretty steep.  I'm not kicking myself - my company paid for it!"
"1","Decided to stop by here (for the first time) last week for a quick fix. I'm not sure if this was an isolated incident, but this was not up to par with the consistency that I would expect eating at any other golden arches restaurant. In fact, both my Big Mac and my girlfriend's were surprising dry! I'm sorry but the secret sauce was not enough to save them! To top it off, we order combos and they really skimped out on the fries (the french fry containers were not overflowing full as I'm used to getting from other Mickey Dee's). \n\nAlso, since they were new and for a \""limited time\"" (and thank the man upstairs for that), we tried out the McBites instead of our usual McNuggets, only to find ourselves in utter disappointment. The McBites were super dry and very hard with very little meat to be found. They were more like fried batter that were sitting too long under a heat lamp. I'm not sure if I'd ever give this location a try again, there were just too many strikes in one instance. Moreover, we went through the drive-thru so it's not like we could've complained to the manager if we ate inside. Overall, this was a bad first impression at this location."
"2","I came here for dinner with a group of friends.  We really wanted to try the Seafood dinner buffet for $30 a person.  When we got there, the line was super long.  It took us at least 1.5 hour before we got seated.\n\nWhen we got seated, I noticed there was plenty of empty tables around us.  I guess Studio B prevents customers from coming in, so the buffet stations won't be crowded.\n\nMy favorite dishes were:\n1.Oxtail soup - The oxtail meat fell off the bone, and the soup was really good.\n\n2. Crab legs - The crabs was cooked perfectly, and it was easy to take out the meat with the red stick thingy.\n\n3. BBQ ribs - Tender ribs\n\n4. Mahi Mahi on Bamboo - the fish was crispy on the outside, and it tasted great with the salsa on top\n\n5. Chocolate Souffle - my favorite dessert\n\n6. Cream Puffs - bite size and fresh\n\n7. Eclair - very good\n\nOverall, I'd definitely come back!  Everything I tried was really good.  The service was great, since the waitress kept taking away our plates and refilling our drinks."
"1","I keep reading these reviews that state that the Burger Bar has BLT gustatively defeated... and I just couldn't resist contributing my two (no doubt significant & highly influential) cents.\n\nAfter my first experience at the Burger Bar, I never wanted to go back. I ordered the sliders while the boy ordered the Kobe. I may have erred with the sliders, but they were so dry and tough...... no place should ever offer them on the menu if they so epically failed at making them. The boy's Kobe was alright, but it hardly balanced out the ick of the unsavory sliders."
"2","Came twice.\n\nFirst was we saw it and we were hungry driving by and 2nd time we brought my inlaws. \n\nIt's no LA, dim sum but I appreciate that they had dimsum through the day as we night people have to wake up \""early\"" to make it to a dimsum cutoff. It was decent both times, though limited...but I would expect so for serving all day. \n\nWe had a few entrees and all we got were very good and where I rate them higher for than the dimsum in terms of taste. I liked that they did a ginger scallion chicken here, but it was crispy chicken instead of steamed...just a different take on a favorite is sometimes nice. Grandma really liked her mongolian beef and it was good- soft meat and not too spicy. Mom in law got lo mein and was happy with it. Got also shrimp walnuts and they were big and fresh. \n\nOverall, not a bad place. Service was decent too and at least I can get a few dimsum dumplings during dinner time. Still- I'm holding my breath on if I'll ever find a place that has amazing dimsum like home."
"1","Run of the mill cheap Chinese fast food and other poor quality fast food grade food."
"2","Had lunch there today and really liked the food. I had the street tacos which were a pretty good value. I had the Tacos Al Pastor, very tasty and affordable. Atmosphere wise it was like being in a Mexico. Probably not a place you would take your girlfriend for a romantic dinner but if you are looking for some good street tacos this is a great place in Chandler."
"1","This place is right around the corner from my house and my fiance and I always take our vehicles here for washes and oil changes. It feels like this place has gotten progressively worse over the last year. This last time was the final straw. We brought both of our vehicles in last Saturday. He needed an oil change and a car wash and I just needed a wash. We waited in the filthy waiting area with the torn and stained furniture and when my car was ready it looked like it hadn't even been vacuumed and there were water spots all over it. We left to run errands before my fiance SUV was done. When we came back he went in to pay and there were additional charges. When he asked what they were for he was told that he need an extra quart of oil. He asked how many quarts were put in and was told 5. He told the girl that the engine was only a 4 quart engine. She looked confused and just stared at him. He told her that this was the last time that we would bring our vehicles there and she didn't seem to concerned. Needless to say we will be finding another place for car washes and oil changes. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Pay the extra couple of dollars and go elsewhere."
"1","Overall I rate Starbucks very highly so for me to write a below 5 or 4 star review there must be a problem.   I spend lots of money for coffee as this is my only \""bad habit\"" as I like to say.  I know my coffee and I know my americanos.\nFirst, I ordered my standard grande americano.  I lifted the lid and it looked like drip coffee.  Americanos if done right need to have to what appears like a thin layer of coffee froth called crema. Its not only about the looks the crema shows that it was brewed right and the full flavor is in the cup.  I indicated very politely to the barista that it wasn't done right and it needed crema and that I wanted another made.  She had no clue what crema was and asked another barista/employee.  This time while she was not very rude but rude enough she said that\"" if I make another one it will come out just like that\""!  I asked her if she knew what crema was and she looked at me as if I was some kind of a demanding crazy man.  She got back and got somebody else because supposedly I had created a BIG problem.  Now I am feeling uncomfortable.  I asked for my money back since I see an unwillingness to make another one.  The now even newer person perhaps a young on duty manager said that I was yelling while I was not.  I might have spoken louder than normal but it was warranted and I was by no means yelling.  I told her I am not yelling and she said yes you are! She is now making everything worse! At this point I had it.\nIt seems that the cocky attitude that some people in the medical field have like doctors carry over to these employees of since  this Starbucks is located near UMC! WOW!\nI frequent Starbucks hundreds of time a year and like I said I know my americanos. The one near my home ALWAYS makes them right!  \nI called Starbucks 800# to complain and their store will hear it from their district manager.\nI even called back the store itself to let them know whom I had just called.  Granted the person that picked up the phone which might have been the manager was very apologetic and knowledgeable of crema but he didn't seem knowing what they do wrong while brewing these drinks either. No issue with him.  \nThey need to figure out how to make americanos right and be more accomondating  to their costumers and not making one feel bad if all their asking is for a better drink!"
"1","At the time of year 2002, the Venetian was the top of line for me. The hotel stay was about $250 a night. I stayed with friends for about 3 nights. The room was huge having 2 queen beds and a sofa queen bed. There were 2 TVs.  One TV in the sofa area and another in the 2 queen beds area. The only issue is that if you remove or move a any items in the refrigerator, then you would be charged that rate for the removed item. I was charged a rate, in which my friend argued with them and they removed the charge.  \n\nNow it should be a 3 star hotel\n\nI have stayed at the Venetian back in 2010 and it was not well taken care of. For better rooms, you would need to stay in the Venezia or the Palazzo. \n\nThe rating of this room is still ok, but not as clean and taken care of as the rest of the other hotels."
"2","Another fantastic service from Jeanette. Yesterday I went in for a facial and did not want to get up off the table. She gives you a very soft wrap around towel to put on before climing in between the sheets for your facial. She also gives you the option of extracting your pores or a shoulder/arm massage. She's the expert so I let her decide.\n\nI am a massage therapist and work at an establishment where I get discounts on facials. That being said, I still decided to trek all the way from the Moon Valley area over to Scottsdale for a facial. It was money and time well spent.\n\nExcellent job Jeannette. Thank you!"
"1","Meh. I 've experienced better, as yelp would say. Totally unimpressive. I was very excited to stay here. Rooms were small and it is at the end of the strip. I way prefer the Venetian, way bigger rooms, normally same price, and more in the middle of the strip! Wont stay here again."
"2","Love this place! Who would've thought I'd be reviewing a library?\n\nThe building is so cool and modern inside. So many places to lounge, a cafe, an outdoor area to chill, and the best thing of all for me is that there is a huge play area in the children's section! With toys, puzzles, and books galore. I haven't had to buy too many books for my little one (she's 1 now!). Instead, I check out 6 to 8 books per every 4 weeks for her to enjoy and they are all usually in good shape. Plus they have a free baby time class there where we can bring our babies. The instructors are so talented. They sing and read books to our babies. They also bring toys for them to play with. My little girl loves it! And loves to be with the other babies as well. Awesome!"
"1","First called and delivery would take over 1 hour. Decided to dine in and no one was there to take my order. It took a couple minutes for someone to realize I was ready to order. (Apparently messing around in the back.) While waiting for the pizza someone was juggling pizza dough and tossing it from one person to another.  Pizza was good but the flavored crust either sucked or wasn't applied. It was clean and pizza was ready really fast. My wife will probably go back but I will not."
"1","Is it possible to give \""zero\"" stars?\n\nI've been in there twice and the employees were rude, both times.  I'm not the \""Scottsdale Elite\"", but seriously... I'm a paying customer too.  The little boy who said he was the manager was rude too."
"1","I'm a huge sushi-buffet enthusiast because I'm cheap and I love mass quantities of food, so I was super-excited to head to Makino's $17 lunch buffet. But I was pretty disappointed by the whole experience. \n\nFirst, because we'd tried to go to their dinner buffet at 9 pm the previous night, but were turned away because they were taking away the food. But I managed to get a glimpse of a gleaming heap of oysters and crab legs that was decidedly lacking at the lunch buffet. \n\nSecond, because all the rolls were tasteless and bland and seemed to be variations of the same thing. I hate deceit! \n\nThird, because of their small selection of fresh sashimi -- I love mackerel, but I was sad to see a few paltry pieces in the corner.\n\nThe best thing about Makino was the dessert bar's chocolate fountain. Holy shit I had no idea how fabulous a thing a chocolate fountain could be. Bowls of fruit and marshmallows with long sticks and a yum yum yummy chocolate coating. But it kind of pissed me off when they turned it off at 2:30, a half hour before their stated closing time.\n\nAll in all, so-so."
"2","The store has a great layout with custom made back issue drawers that are the best I've ever seen in a comic shop. The staff is extremely helpful and have turned me onto several comics and indi books that I probably would never have picked up. They have a huge glass cabinet filled with awesome statues that tend to empty  fast. They also have a gaming calendar with a varying schedule of interests, such as Heroclix, Magic, Yu-gi-Oh, Pokemon, and Beyblades! Jay the owner and staff, hosts many huge events such as comic artists signings from professionals in the industry, free movies at the Rave at Town Center, New Comic Day and parties for various events. If you love comics, new to them or even just want to know what the hoopla is all about, you owe it to yourself to check out MaximuM Comics in Henderson and see for yourself!"
"1","not gonna say they're all horrible but some of the people here at the counter are completely rude, full of attitude and down right IGNORANT. they need people skills training. But then again it is not just my personal experience that LA FITNESS does not care for their image nor for their current members."
"1","Meh. Not a fan.\nSister and I came here after a day of shopping at Norterra. We were famished and super excited for some pita delicious-ness. The restaurant was packed, people were waiting in random spaces so it was hard to tell who had already put their name down or now. We ended up going to the bar.\n\nOur server was super nice and knew a lot about the menu, which was good. The one thing I noticed right away, was that the servers, or employees seemed to all be half dressed. I don't have kids, but there were kids there, and it seems like this is a family enough style restaurant so that was unprofessional to me. \n\nWhen our food came, I had been so excited to try the falafel pita but when I saw it, I wanted to cry and my stomach started to riot. The falafel was burned and bone dry. Made me thirsty just looking at it. and holy onions. There were so many onions, no sauce. just ick. \n\nWe didn't stay long after that. Most likely won't go back."
"1","Where do I start.  \n\nThe burgers - All  were over cooked.\n\nThe fries - they were soggy.  We told the waitress that they weren't edible and sent them back.  She brought out a new order and they were just as bad as the first.\n\nWarm Jumbo Bacon Salad - It's listed under Starter on the menu and that's how we ordered it.  It came out after all the burgers and fries.  The bacon on the salad wasn't cooked.  It wasn't edible.\n\nChocolate Bread Pudding -  It was cold in the center.\n\nWe thought they had a great concept for a restaurant and we love burgers, so we were excited to eat there.  We will never go back."
"2","It's a pretty hole in the wall at the Tempe Marketplace.  I wish they'd be a little more consistent with their flavor selection.  Sometimes you feel like a mint and sometimes you do but they don't have it on that particular visit, meh.\n\nI digress from my 4-star rating.  The yogurts good, the topping selection is better, and more consistent, and the staff is as friendly as can be.\n\nOnly thing I'd change is its location in front of the child trap water pit where it seems like every time I visit, there's a toddler running around sans a diaper."
"2","This is a cozy little place for meeting.  My sister and I had a quick cup of coffee and split one of their generous apple turnovers.  It was the perfect pick me up treat to get through the late morning.  The service was excellent and the food and coffee were perfect.  In addition to the sweets and cakes on display, they have a table with an entire portfolio of notebooks that demonstrate their artistic competence in cake-making for any occasion.  We were not disappointed at all - go support this wonderful bakery!!"
"2","Service is spectacular. We had reservations and showed up early on a busy night - seated immediately. Just hope you're lucky enough to get Tom as your server - everything he recommended was delicious, and trust him with a wine pairing too!\n\nFrom the menu try: Symphony of tuna, beet salad, scallops, mushroom risotto - all done to perfection (although I'm confident anything you choose will be just as good).\n\nOverall - this was the best restaurant experience I've had in years! Thanks Spago!"
"2","Last week I revisited RM for the first time in a long while. I was quite impressed w/ the updated, fresh new look. Its sexier with tons more visual texture. They now serve regular entrees and they were great! No more over-priced, tapas-wannabe!! Yipeee!"
"2","Awesome Ph\u00f3 awesome service!"
"1","God damn this place, another hype restaurant. Let me tell you, I showed up 12 minutes after the opening of business hours, I walk in & the F'n staff isn't saying anything to me, just walking back & forth. Finally I stare down some lady, she looks at me & says \""were at capacity, you need to come back in 3.5 - 4 hours if you want to eat\"" You know what, I don't care how F'n great this place is supposed to be, because that is not good practice, it's ridiculous & any moron who waits that long for food is F'd up in the head!!!! You want good Italian food in Phx.? You aint gonna find it here, because once you drive west of the Mississippi you lose the ethnic flavor & rich history of real Italian food, where you can achieve four star worthy dining at many local neighborhood eateries on a poor man's budget without the hype..."
"1","Okay, the Hot and Ready deal is a joke.  They never have the $5 pizzas ready, and there is always a wait.  To top it off, the last three times I have been there, the clueless counter person has given away our pizza and bread to someone else, making our supposed 10 minute wait closer to 20-25 minutes.  While you can't beat the cheap price, the service is seriously lacking."
"1","Terrible.  I was hoping this place would be a beacon of light in a very average airport. However it does the opposite. The coffee was undrinkable, the prep of the pizza was  poor at best, and the food came out cold.  I was going to send the pizza back but I didn't want to wait another 30 minutes for it. I'm glad had a lot of time before my flight or I would have missed it with the slow service. I will go somewhere else next time."
"1","First Food Bar was the worst dining experience I've had during my recent trip to Vegas.  We came for lunch with our group of 6 and we all ordered different dishes.  My wife had the fish and chips and I had the turkey club with a over medium egg.\n\nThe fish and chips were not good.  I usually like any thing fried but when my wife asked me to taste her meal I thought it cant be that bad.  It was.  The fish was very dry and flaky and the batter taste funny.  The \""chips\"" that came with the meal was good though because it had horseradish sprinkled over it.  My sandwich was decent but was not the best I've ever had.  So why the 2 star review?  Service was sub par.  Our waitress did the bare minimum and was not attentive to our needs.  We had to ask for refills and she didn't put much effort into our table.  \n\nThe others in the group also mentioned that their food was just OK and they would probably skip it the next time they're in Vegas."
"2","The food is always so good and the staff works hard to take care of you even though they are always slammed. The only issue is the noise level. Also the rosemary on the fries... But that is just my preference :)"
"2","Archis is my favorite thai place of all time! I can go on and on about their food. Their tom yum, tom kha, pad thai, papaya salad, and thai tea are my favs!!! oh and their pad prik king (sp?) yum!  Ive tried other thai places, and i always come running back to archis!!\n\nthe only one complaint i have was a couple of times there was this one guy server that seemed like he was saying \""FML FML FML\"" in his head everytime he served us.  Seemed like he didnt want to be there or serve us.  so everytime I ate there i prayed i didnt have him as my server.  Other than him, everyone else is very friendly and the food is awesome!!!"
"2","Appreciated the non gaming and non smoking facility.  It's a very beautiful hotel.  Great views of Vegas."
"1","Oh goodness where do I even start. The customer service was okay, but the food was really not that good. They had a lot of old items out at the buffet bar that looked like it had been sitting out for 3 to 4 hours. I've been to my fair share of Americanized Chinese buffets , but this one was really Americanized and when I mean Americanized I mean it tasted so bad there wasn't even a hint of authenticity was in there. Most likely I will not be back. You would probably have to drag me. The only reason why I did give it 2 stars was because they had a pretty wide selection unfortunately they failed to deliver on the taste. My wife and kids didn't really care for it either and besides you really can not take the kids word for it. Thank God for my wife's cooking though and by the way she is Asian and her food is awesome!"
"2","Pizzeria Bianco is good but fails to live up to the hype of being one of the best pies in the country.  Places like this are scattered throughout first rate cities like New York.  I was lucky that there was no wait because I would have been very disappointed if I had to wait for just a good pie as opposed to one that was exceptional."
"2","Anthony(manager)Steve(svc.mgr) great guys good service,good deals."
"1","I've never liked going here, pretty terrible food and service. I actually know some of the people who used to work here, and they aren't exactly in a clear mind when they clock in. Once there were gnats flying around my food, pretty off-putting. I wouldn't go here again unless i had to. If you do like the food and get past all the bad things, try the mother load. Least terrible thing on the menu- they pretty much just throw everything they can into that sandwich."
"2","Yum! Perhaps not the best pizza out there, but one hell of a fine option if you're in Leith.\n\nThe lunch specials are where La Favorita shines on quality and price. \u00a38.95 nets you a main and drink, or \u00a311.95 with a dessert. The pizzas are large enough to satiate a full appetite, or even to be split if you only have the munchies.\n\nThe mushrooms on their pizzas are the perfect kind; small and flavorful and a perfect compliment to the pepperoni. With some chili oil you've got proper flavor in abundance!"
"2","Schneller, freundlicher Service. Preis/Leistung ist optimal. Guter Tipp f\u00fcr sub-fans."
"1","Horrible and dirty place, this place gave me a toe infection that has not healed in over a month. I dont understand how they any customers. After reading the reviews I still gave them a chance, because it was close to my house and they have alot of foot traffic. Never again will I go here, too dirty to be open!!!!"
"1","Service was decent, even though it was busy for lunch both times.  Food came out quickly, once ordered.\n\nFor the quality level of the food the cost was a bit high.  I believe the lunch specials were around $10.  The Salsa was decent, but the cooked food was greasy.   They do offer the option of black beans instead of refried, which is nice.  There are large portions, but quality of ingredients isn't there, and food is somewhat bland, requiring that you season with the salsa to get some flavor."
"2","Came out to AZ to visit a good friend and she took me here for dinner, deff have to say everything I had was real good; chicken hummus wrap. All on point, well seasoned, good atmosphere and good service over all and the portion size was more then enough. If I'm ever back in Tempe inwould deff go back here for lunch or dinner"
"1","Wow, was I disappointed by this place. It was both my first time in Vegas and my fifth anniversary, so I wanted it to be special. It was special, but the room had nothing to do with it. \nTo start with, the bed, although it had the greatest comforter, had ripped sheets on it. Housekeeping changed them, still ripped, just in a different place. Every time housekeeping was in the room they left something. A rag one day, a bottle of cleaning solution another one. They didn't clean the bathroom very well either. My hair goes everywhere when I dry it and by the fifth day when we left, there was a lovely collection all over the bathroom. \nThe place seems to operate on an ignore guests policy. The casino wait staff are rude and to be honest, this was the worst experience I've ever had in a hotel. There's not enough space here to list every reason. I swear thought, I'm not the complaining type, and I didn't here. I just let it suck and counted the days until I could leave this hotel.\nI would never ever even consider for a minute staying here again."
"2","I love this place. The food is great and fresh tasting ingredients. My husband and I had the Bronx Bomb and it was amazing. \n\nThe service was good. Even though we went at 1 am! The staff was friendly and helpful. I look forward coming back or order in food for delivery."
"1","Pros\nI didn't get sick!!\n\nCons\nThe \""Food\""\n\nWhile in Las Vegas my wife, 10 month old daughter, and I decided to try the Rainforest Cafe located in the MGM Grand. We all enjoyed the decor, the service was so so, but the food was absolutely disgusting. We started things off with 2 waters and a diet coke and ordered the \""Awesome Appetizer\"". All the food on the platter (2 chix strips, 2 chimmi cha cha's ,crab dip, and calamari) was cold except the crab dip which was piping hot. One thing I don't understand is the chix strips and calamari where both very lightly cooked almost underdone but the chimi cha cha (similar to a chili's southwestern eggroll) was overcooked and really dark. Having worked in a restaurant for a few years I knew this was from using old fry oil that had gone too long without filtration or replacement, it causes a burnt crust with an almost smoky/bitter taste and an undercooked center.\n\nFor our main dishes I had ordered a cobb salad and my wife had the \""Rasta Pasta\"". My salad was also pretty bad, a good portion of the lettuce was wilted. It was also pretty clear that they didn't take the time to dry the lettuce after washing it. The wet lettuce couldn't hold onto the dressing which caused a pool of water/dressing to form in the bottom of my bowl. My wifes pasta wasn't as disgusting, but it wasn't good either. The chicken was tolerable but overall the whole dish was dry and bland.\n\nThe total bill for our meal came to just over $70 which is way to much for the quality of the food. After 11 nights in Las Vegas this is by far the worst place we ate at, I have no idea why the MGM Grand would allow the restaurant in it's casino.  It's a shame I have to give this place even one star which is one more than it deserves."
"1","Really Bobby... really?? Another pretentious restaurant trying to serve up  \""out of the box\"" foods. His flavor combinations just did not work, he totally missed the mark. I tried a little of everything and nothing made me want to orgasm in my mouth more like, WTF did you just put in there.... gross and just weird..... And I will eat anything! I got 2 drinks and 2 apps, cost me $100 big ones.... I would much rather lose that in craps in 5 minutes then eat there again...\n\nBUT! The food 'looked' really pretty....... good job on the presentation not so much on the execution.... What are these? Lobster tacos for Ants?!?!\n\nThere are too many other awesome food choices that are just as expensive to spend money on and have an orgasm in your mouth, sorry Bobby your restaurant sucks the Big one! Honey Badger Chef..... Big famous chef, he don't give a shit....."
"2","This new wine lounge serves tapas-style cuisine in an upscale setting.  I recently had dinner here and especially enjoyed the Hawaiian Ahi Au Poivre and Sea Bass Wellington plates. I would change the bread and the mac n cheese recipe.  The service was good throughout and the waiter sold us on dessert by describing the pastry chef as a rock star.  That said, the caramel pear was very good.  I will go back to try the wine/cocktail lounge off the main dining room.   The bar set up appears to remain the same as when the restaurant was Chicago's Own.  I dont find the bar inviting; however, it will probably be popular with the younger set."
"2","My last two breakfasts here I have ordered the 'Healthy Turkey' .... which is an egg white omelette with diced turkey, spinach, feta cheese, diced onions and tomatoes. It is served with an english muffin and is very tasty! ... My husband continues to order his standard raisin french toast smothered in butter and warm blueberry sauce .... with two eggs over easy on the side .... and is still loving it! : ) The coffee is also consistently good and is kept topped up by the great wait staff."
"2","At first I was a little skeptical doing everything online even paying but I \ndid it anyway and let me tell you it was well worth it the LV traffic ticket guy help me a lot no traffic school no. Points off no going to court didn't have to go anywhere just did it all in my house by phone thank you Ticket Guy God for bid if I get another ticket you will be my LV traffic ticket guy"
"1","This morning I give one star. I find it unacceptable to be waiting in the drive thru line with nobody else there at 6:03 in the morning having to wait 3 minutes for my order to be taken. That's unacceptable. Usually I am in an out of the drive thru very quickly however this just irritated me this morning when I'm in a hurry to get to work."
"1","I was massively underwhelmed by the fire festival, but perhaps I just did it wrong? We arrived around 10pm, waited in a long but fast-moving line to buy tickets, and wandered in to see a couple groups of body-painted torch-holders writhing around with joy. They then proceeded to the center of a huge mass of people and started some sort of performance. Couldn't tell you what that was like, as I was uninterested in shoving my way into the crowd to find a vantage point. There wasn't much else to do (unless we were hungry for fast food), so we left pretty early. \n\nIf I were to go again, I would\n1) Either go really early (8pm) and enjoy the sunset or later (after 10pm) and stay through the bonfire at midnight;\n2) Bring a bunch of alcohol (in non-glass containers), and probably some snacks as well; \n3) Go with a large group of people who could keep me entertained with witty banter during the times when there's not much going on."
"2","Surprisingly good food."
"2","Domino's are I guess all supposed to be the same, however this one really shines.\n\nMy food is always correct, the drivers are always quick and the pizza's always taste great! \n\nOnline ordering is simple and a snap, and I love the Pizza Tracker.\n\nIn all this Domino's has a great staff and I really enjoy my lazy dinner days from them.\n\nThanks"
"1","Though JCPenney has been around for years (decades, even), this particular store is new. It is in fact about only a year old. The concept is startling new - it's more like an Apple Store than the old department store model that we are all used to.\n\nAnd that's where it falls down. The problem is that it was built out by a new CEO - who I believe worked for Apple - and it is designed to appeal to those who might shop at an Apple Store. But most people shopping for the latest iPhone aren't going to suddenly shop at JCPenney.\n\nInstead, they are your grandmothers. Or their grandmothers. Which is fine. We all have them. And truth be told, I shop there as well, because their product is better than Wal-Mart, and they have some pretty good sales as well. But I don't go looking for iPhones, or fancy displays.\n\nThough the store isn't bad, it's not JCPenney, and it has these strange little stores within a store - almost like a Black Lion department store, except it's not. And instead of having one price without needing coupons or watching sales, you still sorta need to do that, since the one price concept didn't work. And the layout is really odd. Rather than having men's and women's department's, everything is just all over the place and organized by type - jeans over here and whatnot. I'd probably rather take the old style store. Then, I'm old too, so it explains a lot."
"1","This mouthy Dago needs a lesson in customer service. Plus he treats his help like crap. ( A true test of an asshle owner) You idiots that pass off this poor behavior as New York -ese  should go back there."
"1","I went into this nail salon for the first time with my 3 year-old daughter as she loves to get her nails done and looks forward to it every week. The owner did her nails. While she was painting them, she touched my daughter's forehead and said \""She needs to wax her eyebrows.\"" This was said to my daughter so she could hear. How anyone says this to a child is beyond me. I will NEVER go back and will tell everyone about this. I'm disgusted with this salon and the owner."
"1","First off, the food and atmosphere here is pretty darn good. I live in the area, so it's a nice place to bike over to and grab lunch. The patios are beautiful, amd the inside is comfortable. I love the San Diego Burger, and the Tacos are pretty good for a plqce that doesn't specialize in tacos.\n\nI'm writing this particular review to talk about the service. When Park on Ftemont first opened, I had a number of great dining experoences, but recently the service here has been, for the most part, mediocre if not outright nonexistent. \n\nIn most cases it was simply that the servers had unenthusiastic attitudes, no smiles, and an apparent overall distaste for having to be at work that day. A number of the times the service was slow, and it was hard to get the servers attention without them seeming annoyed. \n\nI understand that this is a pretty high traffic place in the evenings, and none of this is normally bad enough to mention. I mention it now because of the problem I had with the hostess the other day.\n\nI was planning on going to take part in Taco Tuesday with some girlfriends, but I was interested in bringing my sister who was not yet 21. I called ahead to see at what time they stopped searing minors. Since I had been there before with my sister, and had even eaten inside, I thought I had heard the girl on the phone say she could seat minors on the patio after six. When we arrived I told her we had minors in our party and asked if we could sit on the patio. She abruptly and demeaningly informed my party that minors were not allowed here after six. When I began to explain I had called someone earlier, she broke in before I could even finish to say \""that was me, and I can't seat you.\"" Taken aback, I turned around to walk out with my group. As we left, she mumbled \""Have a nice day.\"" All as she sipped on what looked like some sort of mojito based on the color and the muddled mint in the drink.\n\nI was aware that I may have misheard what she had said on the phone, but the fact that she was so unapologetic and just plain mean made me never want to go back.\n\nI'm sure I'll get over it eventually because like I said, the food is good, but I'm not a fan of the \""exclusive, you're-not-worth-our-time, cool-kids only\"" vibe the employees have been giving me. It makes me want to go there, and take new people with me, a lot less."
"2","This buffet is NOT for everyone.\n\nPeople who dines here must appreciate quality and overall value.  The foods prepared at this establishment are cooked to perfection and the waiting staff provided special attention to your every need.  At $62 per person (Memorial Day weekend), one must consider carefully before pulling the trigger.\n\nThe Wynn's buffet has been tops, but they now have a true rival.  May the two of these buffet battle it out for top honors."
"2","I've been coming to Thai Basil for a couple of years and have been searching Tempe for good thai food. This place is awesome. It's right across the street from my dorm, and their food is cooked to order. They are super accommodating to people's tastes and very nice. You can come in for dinner with a huge party and they will do their best to fit you all together. Their dessert of sticky rice is great, the pad thai comes in a huge portion and is fairly priced, the lunch specials are great. I would say this is one of my favorites in Tempe. Being Asian I like eating some genuine Asian food from time to time and this place is great! Their thai tea is awesome enough for me to stop by during the day and grab two for myself."
"2","Loved the store. Russell was most helpful!  The store in my town has never been this attentive to my needs."
"2","BEST SUBS EVER.  Seriously.  We saw this on \""PA n'at with Dave and Dave\"" and it looks awesome.  We took the drive to Swissvale and got us a \""Battleship\"" and it was literally 3 feet long, just the right amount of veggies and meat and delicious.  It was 2 meals worth of food (for two people).  Even better the next day.  And the best part was that it was under 13 bucks.  \n\nIt's great, fast food.  I can't wait to bring friends there to enjoy their selection of 40s along with a Battleship."
"2","I've been to L'Etoile three times and they were all very good. Once I ordered the \""Sea Scallop\"" appetizer for $12. When L'Etoile says sea scallop they mean ONE SCALLOP. So how good does one sea scallop have to be, to be worth two hours of minimum-wage labor? It has to be pretty good, and it was. I was skeptical until I tasted it and it was amazing.\n\nOne star fewer than perfect because I have to save up for a year before I can afford one meal there.\n\nSpecial thanks to excellent waiter Frank."
"1","What a nightmare of a hotel.  Construction does not seem to stop so bring your ear plugs if you get a room opposite it.  My room is old and dirty.  I found other people's stuff in it.  If you are looking for a cheap room, it's here.  I am only staying here because I am part of a business conference.  I would never come back here if I had a choice."
"2","Wow. Just happened by this place with my friends. We were seated quickly right in the middle by a cool lit up eifel tower. Loved the ambiance and the food was AMAZING!!! A little pricey with small portions but so elegantly prepared. We waited a little longer than usual between appetizers, main course, and dessert, but it was worth it, and it was also a busy Saturday night. Everyone was friendly, the food was to die for, and the decor and atmosphere was so very nice."
"1","We were attempting to purchase a home in the Vegas area and in this tight market, needed everything to go smoothly in financing in order to not have our deal fall through.\n\nNot only did our loan officer not make the process smooth, he overlooked simple qualifications that needlessly ate time. We had to change loan types in between because he did not look at the debt on our credit report correctly and so we had to restart the whole process which burned a week.\n\nWhile the credits markets were rocky over the couple of weeks we were obtaining this loan(which we could have avoided had simple conditions not been overlooked earlier) our officer used it to change between rates as high as 4.5% to 3.75% back to 4% with added costs that were not disclosed earlier. Not only do I watch markets anyways, a week with a fluctuation like the one described above would be catastrophic in the economy. \n\nWe were in constant need to do financial gymnastics to pay down loans and meet conditions which is not the fault of WJ Bradley completely (mortgage laws are crazy now), but the lack of warning and preparation was, and again, could have been avoided had our officer been more attentive.\n\nWe did not get low costs or good rates with WJ Bradley, nor did we receive competent service to justify the higher costs."
"1","Very nice store.  They had a couple really cute dogs walking around and one in baby crib that was just adorable.  This is a great place to go for one of kind items or great gifts for the dog lover but nobody paid attention to us.  Nobody made eye contact nobody said hello so we just walked out."
"1","Wait staff was attentive but the food was very bland. Nuts in the Kung Pao Chicken looked like they came straight from a Planters jar. Place has potential but they need to step it up a bunch in my book"
"2","Love their carne asada tacos! We have never had anything but great quick service and good food from mi casita. One of the workers was telling me they will probably close down when their lease is up and I truly hope they don't."
"1","Whoa. Not what I was expecting AT ALL. The tenders were okay but way too salty for my liking.  I think the waffle would have been okay but we had it delivered so it was mad soggy by the time I ate it. \n\nThe garlic fries were delicious even if they were soggy.\n\nThey didn't have the pasta salad that we wanted so they offered to change it up and gave me the choice of greens or slaw. I chose the greens and asked if it was the same price, he said \""yes\"" but I checked the menu anyway and all the salads were the same price. When I opened the bag I was astonished at the size of the salad... And not the good type of astonished. You're better off buying a side salad from JoBos.\n\nAlso, the beignets were completely off. They were deflated squares full of air and really tough for beignets that were only an hour old. I really expected more since they're in the name of the establishment.\n\nI had high hopes for this place but I'm disappointed with my experience to say the least. But like I say, I'm willing to try anything twice. Maybe next time I'll actually eat there."
"1","As a new patient I expected to be treated with a little more respect. I waited for OVER two hours without seeing anyone, finally I just left. While I was in the outer waiting room, there were other patients complaining about how it is \""always like this.\"" I agree with the other reviews also, the front desk employees seemed both aloof and clueless, and not entirely helpful. Avoid this place, I recommend."
"2","love the cozy fireplaces in winter, uncrowded/classy bar, flaminco dancers, waterslide, beach pool, lots of jacuzzi's, friendly staff, relaxing couches"
"2","The people aren't lying. This lobster roll is drenched in butter and guaranteed to be a key contributor in your untimely death. You better love it or leave it alone."
"1","Not the best Starbucks in the land. The people are friendly enough but they have made our drinks wrong on multiple occasions. Also, they get their deliveries through the front door and the shop is essentially a long hallway so if you are there in the evening, prepare to have lots of material rolling past you. One of the delivery men even dumped a few boxes on a customer last time I was there. They do have some nice outdoor seating with misters but it is right on the corner of a parking lot so it's usually loud."
"1","Man, every time I've gone to this place, the food looks a lot better than it tastes. I've found all the food to be incredibly bland. Disappointing because the atmosphere is pretty cool."
"2","Myself and my girlfriend decided to stay here for a couple of nights while visiting Scotland and I've gotta say I was more than impressed. \n\nThe staff were so friendly and helpful and had a fantastic knowledge of places for us to go. The also gave us a discount card for one of the local pubs which was great. \nThey also did a discounted breakfast for a cafe next door which served lovely food!\n\nWe stayed in a private double room as we weren't up did bunking with loads of people. The room we stayed in was like an apartment more than a hostel. Fully kitted out with a great view if the city. \n\nThe hostel is positioned right bang in the heart of Edinburgh. Less than a ten minute walk from everything. There was so much to do and even though we were only in Scotland for a few days it was beautiful.\n\nI would recommend this place to anyone visiting Scotland and looking for cheap accommodation and great location. Loved every moment in the hostel and will be back again."
"1","I can't believe I failed to write my review so long ago! The memories still leave me shuddering... bleh.\n\nThis place suuuucks. Food, service, prices, everything! The colorful, \""chaotic\"" decor was what brought my friends, husband and I in on one not-yet-drunken afternoon for lack of more variety of places to eat in our hotel, and we were starving.\n\nI immediately Yelped and was pretty terrified to eat here. I mean really, I think a restaurant actually has to work at it to get so many incredibly low ratings. Once seated we ordered one of those massive margaritas which my girlfriends shared (such a waste of money; the cup is shaped like a fatty goblet but is really hollowed out like a wine flute inside.. bye bye $$$). \n\nI ordered what seemed to be the safest thing on the menu - a cheese quesadilla with guacamole ($11.90 + 2.00 for guac... this thing better be gourmet!). I can't remember what everyone else ordered but they all seemed to shoot for \""safer\"" options as well. My top-dollar quesadilla, which was really just a couple flour tortillas with melted shredded cheese in between, arrived with no guac. I tried to flag our waitress down but she completely ignored us after our food was delivered.\n\nThen we tried to flag her down again for another round of waters. Ignore, ignore, ignore - we got the attention of a busboy who said he'd tell her but she still never came. \n\nThen they turned on that hokey cha cha slide song and tried to get everyone up, servers and patrons, to dance. Our waitress amazingly reappeared to try and drag me to dance and I kindly refused and asked, \""can I just get a water please??\"" She ignored me and went to dance. I honestly could not believe her!\n\nIn the end we never got waters, I never got guac (and she attempted to charge me for it), and our waitress \""split the bill\"" between me and my friends but charged some of their expensive margarita onto mine. When I pointed out the error she said I was wrong, and the bill was just fine. I was done fighting with her so we paid and left NO tip. I can count less than five times in my life I've done that but in this case it was well-deserved. We will NEVER go back"
"1","First of all I feel scammed here.  Why didn't I read the Yelp reviews beforehand?   I would have avoided this place like the plague. We got a fast talking rep at the counter, Carmen.\n\nI gave her a copy of my Costco Travel rental car reservation.  Whenever I rent a car I always decline additional insurance as I've got AAA insurance which I specifically told her.  Carmen is fast talking during the entire transaction and says we must have minimum insurance coverage.  Oh, o.k.  Not knowing we are paying additional $26 more each day.   She says sign here and here on a digital tablet, and we do.\n\nIt wasn't until she hands us a hard copy of the rental agreement and we look at it later that we see the additional charge.  I ask if we can we get it back, and she just giggles.\n\nAvoid Budget at all cost.   Unscrupulous business practices.  We ended up paying an additional $104.00.\n\nSubsequently I wrote an email to customer service disputing the $104.00.  Of course the rep sides with Carmen based on the written agreement that we agreed to optional liability insurance.   Sign here, and sign here on a small digital screen doesn't allow the consumer to read it in total.  Too bad for Budget as they've lost what could have been a repeat customer."
"2","Asian and Latin fushion = yummy!  Must get the sea bass and miso skewers!"
"1","I used to love this place. I'm not sure what happened but every single time I've gone it's proceeded to get worse and worse. \n\nI invited my friend from across town tonight to experience his first hibachi and I'm almost embarrassed. 1st off, management has this place very understaffed. Almost all the grills were going and they had two servers to serve the entire place. The poor waiters were running around with their heads cut off. It wasn't their fault for the issue but because of the issue the service was TERRIBLE.\n\n1) Our salads were brought out about 20 minutes after ordering and they didn't bring enough for our table. He apologized and ran back to the kitchen but got side tracked serving every other table that the salad was forgotten about. \n\n2) Our soup came out when the chef was cooking. The waiter couldn't keep up, not by his fault. \n\n3) Our drinks weren't filled. He didn't have time. \n\n4) Our chef was speaking Spanish almost the whole time he was cooking to the Spanish speaking group at our table. I love myself a group of Spanish speaking people but when I'm paying $22+ plus for my \""show\"" and dinner I'd like to know what's being discussed...\n\n5) Our check came about 30 mins AFTER we were all finished. My group and the other group literally sat there looking at each other and looking around for our waiter that was slammed with other tables. Then you sat waiting for another 10 minutes for him to come back and get our cards to run them.\n\n6) 18% gratuity was automatically put on BOTH groups check. I had a group of 4. They had a group of 5. I'm sorry. The service was horrible. The food was mediocre. The poor waiter totally didn't deserve a $20 tip and that wasn't his fault at all. Since when did a party of 4 start getting billed for service too? SUPER TACKY!\n\n7) When you walk in there's giant signs posted everywhere about how they longer take gift cards and refuse to take some coupons or something. It screamed unfriendly, cold, and you're about to get charged a ton of money for a bad experience but we don't get a crap... NO DISCOUNTS! \n\n8) My 12 year old twins were told they were too big to order off the children's menu so their dinner was $10 more each. The menu says 12 and under. Do I need to start bringing birth certificates with me to prove my age when I order steak and shrimp?\n\nThis was probably our 10th time attending and will be my last. Just avoid the place at all costs. You're better off running to Panda for some fried rice and orange chicken down the street, or better yet.. grab a burger from Freddy's in the same parking lot. Save your $150 and run into Best Buy next door and buy yourself something worthwhile. They clearly don't care about the reviews being left here either. It really says a lot and I wish I had read these before I came home so angry that I had to take the time to warn others."
"1","Use to love Cafe Rio when we lived in Idaho, went all the time! I was pretty excited that they were coming to Goodyear. First visit was barely ok, prices are higher, very slow no hard tortillas for tostada had to wait, breaking down line at 8:30pm and not great guest service at all. The second time was again like the first but something seemed very salty (beans or chicken?) to the point I couldn't finish it. The vanilla coke looked light so I waited for the cashier who had disappeared, so I waited till she returned and she was like oh yeah we're out, so you'll have to pick something else. Ok?\nI use to love Cafe Rio as it was something I could grab that was priced well, fresh and everyone liked at home. What happened to the old Cafe Rio I remembered ?"
"1","Tried Abuelo's last night with some friends. Ambience and decor are lovely.\n\nHad Grandieza frozen margarita ($5!) that was solid and refreshing! It took me 1.5 hours to polish off due to its size and brain freeze side effect.\n\nHuge fan of their green salsa! Sweet (like a hint of mango?) and mild.\n\nOrdered the beef chimichanga - not the best...I guess I assumed it would be shredded beef when it was ground! It tasted elementary and cafeteria-like. But - the papas con chili?!? Soooo tasty!\n\nA friend split the Fajitas-for-two with another friend. With their order, they received a plate of lettuce, onion, cheese. One politely asked if they could get a little more. The waiter acts like lettuce is rare and sacred and tells her \""Well, lemme see what I can do\"". What??? Dude, make that happen - we're talking lettuce and tomato here!! Smh\n\nNo add'l fixings were provided. That's just not providing a positive customer experience, IMO.\n\nI won't be back for a full meal, but wld entertain just having their papas and a margarita at the bar."
"1","If you positively rated this establishment, either you were drunk and were in a different Restaurant and couldn't remember what it was called or you're use to paying people who physically abuse you while wearing little clothing and lots of straps. \n\nKahunaville is by far the worst place you could probably go to in Vegas; maybe the later evening party scene with flare is why people who rated this did so, but seriously... you're a moron. \n\nWe went here the first morning we arrived in Vegas, there were three couples waiting for assistance at the front desk which had its sign for the waiting area actually pointed down the hall away from the establishment... OK what ever... we stood at the podium, and we stood some more; finally 15minutes went by and we got our name on a list along with 1 other couple; the third was told to wait. Every few minutes someone would come up and look at the list and run away. We left after 30 minutes. Later that day we complained to the manager who met us at the front desk, she seemed very nice but was one of the people who was providing poor service that morning. She claimed that it was abnormal since she had 3 employees call in sick that day and invited us to return, a meal on her to receive great service that they're known for... boy was I an idiot to accept. We went in the next morning, and though we were sat quickly we saw our waitress 3 times... she took our order, she dropped off our food, then she dropped off our bill. A coffee carafe means, I DO NOT have to come back to fill your mug or talk to you again, and after having sat there for 10min after my food was delivered to inform the waitress my steak and eggs breakfast was wrong is pathetic. The eggs which were ordered Over Medium, had very little yoke on one egg, the other was NONE, the Steak which was ordered Well Done was dark on the outside but bloody rare on the inside... basically grill was way too hot and it burned the outside while the inside of my steak was cold and VERY red. I was told they could re-fire it, but what's the point of throwing a burnt raw steak on a grill? How does that solve it? I told the waitress not to worry about it, wasn't her fault even though she should have known by looking at it something was wrong, and should have informed the cook not to give her that crap. We didn't pay for our meal, but the manager never stopped by to make sure we were taken care of based on our first horrible attempt to visit, and the staff was running around completely lost, I saw 8 tables inside, and two wait staff plus 1 hostess who's entire plan to seat people was \""This way\"" then walk as quickly to a table as she could, drop the menus off then abruptly leave, most the customers couldn't keep up with her. The food here is fairly pricey, the service is downright rude if not generally nonexistent and the cooks probably couldn't handle a hungry-man TV dinner in a microwave.\n\nConstantly you'll see women in Hawaiin clothing trying to give away coupons for free drinks and money off your meal, they do this because once you go there you'll not want to return."
"2","I'm also surprised at the bad reviews. \n\nMy friends and I ate here for the first night we were in Vegas. We were seated in the back and ordered a variety of appetizers and entrees. I ordered sushi while my friends ordered the family style meal. The service was wonderful. Our waitress was fast, friendly, and courteous. She happily brought us out drink after drink and timed my sushi with my friends' meals perfectly. A few other people assisted her in bringing out plates and each was more courteous then the last. \n\nPortions are gigantic. The food was delicious. The mixed specialty drinks were even more delicious. She even then gave my friend and I who did not order the family style meal free ice cream that was super tasty! \n\nI would have happily eaten here again."
"1","I was there about a year ago watching football with my girlfriend. It was so loud in there we could not even hear our conversation. The place was short staffed and took a long time to get our order. When it came out it was cold so we had to send it back to be reheated. Our waitress did try her best but was overwhelmed. Its fine when it is not busy there but when it is crowded I do not recommend it."
"1","came here for a lunch buffet, and i am a huge fan of indian food. Friend took me to one in squirrel hill and it was delicious but this was not the case here at tamarind.  I live right down the street at the king edward and was hoping this place would be a gem. Okay.. i tried i really really TRIED to like this place but when your chicken tikka masala is the ONLY dish i'd consider borderline acceptable during a lunch buffet, that's a problem. \n\nc'mon its chicken tikka masala. make the chicken tender and the sauce takes care of itself. this felt like chewing rubber with a side of gravel. \n\nthe one star is there for the excellent service. who was also nice enough to leave his name, Martin (standup fellow) and number (i wouldn't be so cruel) on a napkin for our friend because she was cute as hell"
"2","We had been to only one groomer before and each visit I never had that warm fuzzy feel.  When my normal groomer couldn't get my dog in I decided to try something new and got a last minute appointment at Jeannie's Grooming.  I felt warmth when I entered the door.  When we walked in there were 4 or 5 smiling groomers welcoming us.  The deciding factor for me was when we brought Lola home she was excited and playful.  Not scratching herself on the floor and hiding.  She also had the cutest cut I have ever seen on her!  Thank you, we have found a new groomer!"
"1","Been here for lunch a few times.  Today was exceptionally disappointing.  We asked to be seated in a location with a little more privacy, suggesting a table.  After the hostess seats us, we wait for 5 mins while servers buzz around all the other tables.  My friend decides to go up to the hostess area to let them know we'd actually like to get served in this century.\n\nWe order the 'Bottomless Soup & Salad'.  It comes with bland tortilla chips & some decent pureed salsa.  The tortilla & baked potato soups are cream based, so it's pretty rich.  The house salads are ok but nothing to brag about.  \n\nThe best thing about this place was our assigned server Jeff.  He was extremely apologetic about the 'rocky start' as he called it.  Our food came out within minutes of placing our order & I think he checked on us @ least 6 times.  We really appreciated his effort despite the food quality."
"1","Needs to be updated the rooms are looking dated and walking around after 10 pm is not advised. I paid with Hotwire $65.00 per night but it would have been two double beds. I paid $20.00 more per night for a king with a view of drunk park. Cops look at them and they look at the cops. Still not bad place but not great."
"1","Worst Starbucks I've ever been to! The staff is extremely rude and act like you are inconveniencing them. Also it's the SLOWEST!! It's a joke, every time I go it takes them nothing short of 30 mins in the drive thru line. I will usually drive out of my way to avoid this location."
"2","For all of you weight-loss oriented new year's resolution folks who can't bear to stop eating out and about, here's the solution.\n\nThis place is GENUINELY healthy (I'm still glaring at you, True Food), damn good, and totally affordable (Thanks, LocalDines!).\n\nSome breakfast standouts include the gluten-free Belgian waffles. They're smothered in almond butter, coconut cream, and bananas. Give me that over whipped cream and chocolate chips any day, fatties. That was rude. I take that last part back. Moving on... The frittata was also delicious. Eggs, vegetables, cheese (or rice cheese), and a whole-grain english muffin with jam. Perfect morning fuel, and one of the only guiltless breakfasts I've enjoyed out on the town (eff you, Matt's Big Breakfast, with your glutinous temptations oozing with fat. Okay, I still love you.)\n\nFor lunch, the gluten-free pasta, veggie burger, and burrito have all been awesome. Yes, gluten and dairy-free individuals can still enjoy a fat, cheesy burrito. Deprivation is for wusses.. you can look good and enjoy food here. If you don't like soft veggie burgers, don't order this one. I loved it, though. Veganaise is my friend.\n\nThe Parfait is probably the healthiest, most decadent I've ever had at a restaurant. Layers of bananas, chocolate pudding, almond butter and strawberries. Majorly satisfying (mildly orgasmic). I'd eat it for dinner and be full until the next day. In fact, I may go do that right now."
"2","To get more detailed I would give it a 3.7. The highlight of this place are the drinks and desserts. The meals are above average but it wasn't as great as I expected it to be."
"2","I like this place.  I have been to the location on west Sahara several times.  I just went to the north Rainbow location and it was actually better than the Sahara location!  The only thing that would earn more stars would be the inconsistent service.  Sometimes it is great and other times it is just ok."
"2","Another perfect dive bar in Polish Hill. I would put their drink and food specials up against any other bar in Pittsburgh. This is the definition of a blue collar, slightly punky dive bar. The food is greasy, the people are grungy, and the beer is mostly the cheap stuff that you drink without complaint. And who can say no to a happy hour with a burger, fries, and a Yuengling for under 5 bucks?? That's right: no one. Front and back room that's dark, (really) smokey, and a stage in the back for live music (the scene is ok). I stop by every couple of weeks after work with my boss, and I recommend anyone else to do the same- and make sure to come for happy hour. Here's to seeing you there sometime!"
"1","No one felt like going out in the heat, so we ordered in a pizza - thin crust, mushrooms, pepperoni and garlic. The phone service was great, the delivery time SUPER-fast,even though it was the lunch rush.\n\nBut, unfortunately, the pizza wasn't really all that, in my opinion. The toppings and flavor were alright, though quite salty -- the sauce was sweeter rather than zestier, but the garlic was cooked well and the pepperoni was sufficiently savory.\n\nThe cut it in squares (like Marco's, which is way better, IMO) and I do like that kind of cut.\n\nBut I didn't care for the crust. It's definitely a Chicago-style crust -- not chewy, not crispy, kind of airy and bready, even the thin crust. I think if that's your thing, you'll like this pizza -- it's just not my jam.\n\nThey're pretty pricey for pizza, so beware.  $17 for a large, plus $2 per topping. By the time we were done (added on cheesebread at the last minute, but received cheesesticks), it was a $33 pizza.\n\nMeh."
"2","One of my favorite places in Phx. Clost to the house and very clean and freindly."
"1","Poor service, indifferently cleaned food, and weak seasoning.  The menu also didn't match the food actually served, so I got to eat pork for the first time since my conversion 20 years ago.  \nThey were FAR from apologetic. We will not be back."
"1","Couldn't give an honest assessment of the food since we ended up walking out.  Waited nearly 5 minutes to be seated (there was no one in front of us when we got there).  First thing we see is a waitress complaining that the order she's holding was not what the customer wanted, and another waitress was kind of arguing with her about it.  FInally got seated, then waited at least another 5 minutes before our waitress came by, who happened to be the complaining waitress above.  She asked what we wanted to drink, my wife said coffee, and then I told her we're ready to order.  She then said we'll have to wait a minute and took off.  Again, we waited another 5 minutes, no coffee in sight, and noticed no one was getting their food, and another waitress was apologizing to folks about why it was taking so long.  We ended up walking out, which we rarely do unless service is horrible, which this absolutely was."
"2","This place simultaneously makes me happy and freaks me out.  It's great to be able to find tons of (mostly Asian, but also some other ethnic) food items not available at most grocers.  This time, I enjoyed some new rice types (they have at least 10-20 varieties), interesting noodles (purple wheat?), Japanese rice seasoning and jamaican jerk marinade.  So far all have been a hit.\n\nThe freaky parts are the random fish heads floating in a bucket in the refrigerated section.  And other indecipherable items.  Yikes.  Prepare for some strong smells and potentially scary sights.  But really great prices on lots of ethnic cooking ingredients - totally worth it."
"2","Amazing Peking duck salad. I also had the scallops. Delicious!!!"
"2","Came back a third time for happy hour last night! Pleasantly surprised by the make your own burger options!"
"1","Just moved to the area from out of state. Ate here once and not only was my family disappointed with our meals but there was a hair in the basket of chips that looked to be pubic hair! My husband took the basket to the counter and quietly showed the owner not wanting to make a scene. All that the owner did was closely examine the hair and turn his back not saying one word! Not even an apology! Never again will we eat there."
"1","Never again !\n\nThe fish here is as cheap as you can get, pre-fabricated fish squares that are slightly better than McDonald's filet-o-fish. The shrimp that I ordered were flat, like pounded out flat, who knows what this crap was. The fries  were limp and flavorless. The only thing that made this any better was the \""special sauce\"", which I believe to be hot sauce & ketchup.\n\nThis place is SUPER cheap and the food reflects why. There is no reason I will ever eat here again, peace out Pete's !"
"2","BEING SORT OF A NARCISSIST, I STARTED WRITING A MEMOIR...\n\nCHAPTER 3:   WHAT I LEARNED IN JUNIOR HIGH\nInspired after reading about Pablo Picasso's legendary ways with women, I drew a beautiful pastel of a girl I had a crush on.  Surprising Tomiko with the portrait totally creeped her out and she never spoke to me again.  I learned that females are not impressed by something you spent hours creating in a basement.\n\nCHAPTER 28:  I SEDUCE A WOMAN WITH ART\nI invited my sweetie to dinner at Picasso Restaurant.  Fine dining beside Bellagio's synchronized fire-hydrants while surrounded by 50 million dollars worth of genuine Picasso paintings appears to have a certain effect on women.  The coveted table #34 has the best view of said fountains.  Using the opportunity to charm my sweetie with my knowledge of art, I explained that the colorful squiggles on the dinner plates were identical to the Picasso designs I'd seen at Museu Picasso in Barcelona.  I also freestyle-critiqued a few of the paintings on the walls (secretly, I couldn't name any of them).  As we enjoyed the magnificent meal, I commented that Chef Julian Serrano is like an artist, then immediately regretted making such a banal comparison.  My sweetie was too deep in a state of rapture to care."
"1","Time and time again I've tried to use great gates for jobs I bid, but I'm done giving them chances. No contact, no followup, no returned calls or emails. They're not worth the hassle."
"2","As far as Chinese places in this area , I think this is one of the best. Their food is less greasy than wang and king and they are very fast and affordable . Had way better Chinese food in Florida and the UK to be honest but for around here this place can't be beat...   (:"
"2","Based on recommendations from this site, I booked Perfect Hair and Makeup for my wedding day on 1/1/15. The email correspondence was quick and professional. The ladies showed up a bit early (always better!) and they started with hair and makeup for my sister. My sister is very into vintage pinup style and they really worked and did what she wanted. She is always beautiful, and that day was no exception. She looked absolutely perfect. \n\nOn to my hair and makeup. I wanted a beehive type style with a cute headband, and they nailed it. I asked for light eye makeup, fake lashes and bright red lipstick. It was perfect. I felt like a princess all night. \n\nAlthough not originally scheduled, they were able to fit my new sister-in-law for her hair. They did a beautiful fishtail braid. Everyone loved it! \n\nI highly recommend these ladies for any wedding or special event. They're so great!!"
"2","The Desert Botanical Gardens in Phoenix, AZ is a great way to get a sample of Arizona's diverse and spectacular flora.  Check out The Gardens in the spring, when all of the plant and flowers are blooming in beautiful, vibrant colors.  This is a great place to take visiting relatives who love to garden or are just nature buffs.   It's an easy walking adventure with many cozy benches to sit and bird or nature watch.  Midway through the journey is a nice spot to enjoy a little refreshment and sample some yummy treats.  At the end of your journey is a great gift shop with books, jewelry and even plants found on the garden grounds for sale.  Visit when the day time temperatures are moderate and you're guaranteed to have an enjoyable time.  Be sure to wear sunscreen and bring a camera.  Don't forget to have fun!"
"2","Dillards offers a great selection of Miss Me jeans, UGG Boots and Throws. I never had a problem with the customer service. The girls are always friendly & offer help. They are on the high end side so if your on a budget definitely wait for a sale :) plus their restroom is the ONLY one I would use inside the Fashion Show Mall."
"1","I call in here as little as possible. The bar staff are tone faced. Its a working mans pub. Regulars dour faced. No sky TV, no atmosphere, no food. The only redemption I can think of is,there are two exit doors. Not for me I'm afraid."
"2","It's like a portal into a chasm of anime, classics, world, documentary and varied films and cartoons. For Champaign, these guys really have an outstanding collection of rare films.\n\nWhat prevents me from giving it 5 starts is their stupid rule that you must have a special card and meet special requirements to rent a film from them, including being over 18 (for *ANY* film)"
"1","I have been to many a asian mart in my day but this place is really the epitome of the stereotype of an asian mart. \n\nThere are no windows in the bulk of the store and the windows in the front are all covered up......I have no idea why..........\n\n.......still wondering why.........\n\nMoving on, I can see the appeal of this store as they do carry 13208923874820983534 brands of oriental specialty items like all of the candies, snacks, dried food, teas, etc. This place is packed from ceiling to the ground and the aisles were just afterthoughts! \n\nThe produce section was borderline scary and I would never buy produce from there. With the amount of people that were in there when I was there I would think that they would have enough money to expand....or at least brighten the place up a bit!!! There wasn't too many things in the produce section that I wouldn't be able to find in another grocery store, although I'm pretty sure they would never be as cheap at another place!\n\nDisappointed that they didn't carry any oriental dishes/cups/teapots/platters/etc.\n\nI wouldn't come back unless I was in DIRE need of something that I couldn't find anywhere else...the way that the store is kept is really a reflection of the owners interest in it....and this place is seriously depressing."
"1","Worst manicure/pedicure place in Phoenix. They are done in about 10 minutes and are rude while you're there. The place is dirty also. I went because of the location and I would not go back."
"2","Stumbled across this place while working a photo shoot in the area and we ordered in.  Since then we haven't stopped eating at Athenian Express.   A good five miles out of the way.    What attracted us?  Great food, great prices and the owners wife was undeniable friendly.  Seriously one of the genuinely nicest people I have ever met.   I started out with the Turkey Pita.  Delicious. Yet she urged me to be more creative.   Love it all now including the staff.   There isn't a day where it isn't hussle and bussle in the place,  yet the service is fast and always accurate.  Seriously, I eat it almost every day."
"1","Awful just awful, I gave them my car Thursday night at 4, I was informed a part needed ordered they would call me when finished, I called them the following Wednesday confused on why it was taking so long, I was informed it was done Friday and he thought he called me to tell me, I will not be going back, just crap service!!"
"1","Long wait, food was weak. Even Ray Charles could see this meal was a fail."
"1","Hope they will improve on the long line. Food is ok not so authentic on the taste buds.... But the employees are nice especially our server."
"1","So go thru the drive thru and get ignored. No one answers then decide ok I will go inside. Once inside the only person in the place doesn't acknowledge I am there while he is making good and I am there at the counter waiting 20 min and not one word. WORST SERVICE EVER!!!!"
"2","I have been looking for a new shop since i came to Phoenix about 2 years ago. I was on my way to a different tattoo shop and decided to stop at Inkenstein just to check it out on the way. I showed up at the right time as Jason was finishing with a customer so i had no wait time. I threw out my ideas, he gave his, tweaked them a little bit and i ended up with a perfect tattoo. Exactly what i pictured. My wife will be coming here soon for her next tattoo and i will be back for sure."
"2","I love this place. It's beautifully decorated and the service is excellent. I have been here a few times and each time was consistently great. They are more one the \""fine\"" mexican cuisine scale. They make an avocado mousse, that's like guacamole, only better. It's silky and creamy and oh so delicious. Their queso dip was excellent as well. Try their dip sampler it has the two I listed and one other. I've had a taco plate here and a quesodilla, both excellent."
"1","I will gladly post and provide the police report to any owners. Further comments from Tammy will result in not only Tammy's arrest but a civil suit against her. Any further communication is considered harassment. Wiggles and Wags is not the place to bring your pet. If you do then you are foolish. They use to have one girl who was great. Otherwise, the place really has horrible customer service. Hopefully your pets do not have any medical conditions if you choose to bring your pets to Wiggles and Wags as they will be in great danger."
"1","This place is pretty bad... got a honeydew boba that took forever to get. The boba balls tasted like dirty fingers or dishrags, maybe a combo of the two. The drink tasted like over milked sugar. No distinct flavor. Horrible experience. Will not be returning this tacky place. Waste of money. If I could give zero stars I would."
"2","Had the fried shallot salmon roll, awesome! Very fair prices and a nice atmosphere. Can't go wrong."
"2","This place is amazing. What friendly service too! I ordered the steak w poached eggs on chilequiles . Everything was SO fresh and delicious tasting!!!!!!! My steak (ordered med rare) was cooked perfectly and tender! And the waitress was so nice & attentive. Loooooooove this place !"
"1","I'll openly admit that I haven't had much Filipino food, but the food I had here came with tons of bone fragments. Choking hazard, dental damage hazard, and simply not acceptable for restaurant food.\n\nNo signage, pricing, or menu available, just the dried-out and uncovered options at the buffet, labeled on the sneeze guard. I was handed a Styrofoam box to scoop my own rice from the cooker, and employee packed my two entr\u00e9es of chicken adobo and curry chicken. Limited options, all looked dry, was disappointed not to have any soup or lumpia. \n\n$6 total was small for the heavy box of food I received, but you get what you pay for. Chicken in both dishes was of low quality with a lot of gristle, and bone fragments were everywhere. Sauces for both dishes were understated and borderline bland, neither had any spice to it at all.\n\nThe buffet style doesn't lend itself to high expectations in the first place, but Fiesta Filipino manages a much higher quality with fresher food... and no bone fragments.\n\nEDIT: All you people posting 5-star reviews just because this place is \""so clean\"", apparently you regularly give your business to dirty restaurants?!  Sorry, upholding the health department code isn't enough for me."
"2","I lived in Japan for about 2 years so its awesome to see a real izakaya (albeit a small one) style place here in LV!!  My wife is Japanese so she ALWAYS goes for the \""okura natto\"".  I just wished they had namadais.  But yeah..if I need my fix of yakitori, okonomiyaki and ramen.  There isn't a better place so close to my apartment."
"2","The best real and authentic Mexican tacos.. You must try this place on the strip they stay open until 4am! I love it I'm decently going back to this spot the food here is simply amazing!!"
"2","Convenient and delicious. Slightly higher price than other 'drive-thrus' but the portion size is relative. Even at the drive through I wait a little while, but honestly- it's worth it - which says alot!\n\nI will definitely keep going back."
"2","Just had one of the best dinning experiences of my life and it only lasted 35 minutes because I was running late, but I can not wait  to go back to Good Food.  At first glance Good Food is very inviting, with cork block walls and wood ceilings, a nicely stocked bar and an open kitchen, but what really gives it a nice fealing is its warm and inviting staff and of course the food. Our waiter Jeffrey was amazing we didn't tell him we were in a hurry, but our food moved out of the kitchen quickly throughout our meal and we never felt rushed. We did not order alchohol that night and he still treated us as if we were his only customers. Oh and did I mention our food?   We indulged ourselves in perfect portions of pea risotto, Korean beef stir fry, heirloom tomato  homemade mozzarella salad, and a cheese plate. When we went to leave our waiter said no dessert and we explained we were in a rush. He said no problem and quickly brought out our check and thanked us for coming, Another waiter saw us get up and asked if  everything was ok? He was truly concerned we were unhappy and we could not be more delighted with the service or our meal. Loved it!  Never have I seen a staff take so much pride in a restaurant. Can't wait to come back!"
"1","Went to Raising Canes today. First I have to say the place was clean and the staff was nice. I had  the Box which consisted of 4 chicken fingers, fries, coleslaw ,toast and drink. The chicken was hot and not too greasy and seemed pretty fresh, but bland bland and more bland !! The sauce was okay but no real spice or flavor, need more choices in sauces, fries soggy not fresh, frozen and not cooked well, coleslaw out of a box not fresh. In my opinion it was very expensive for the quality of food. Won't be back."
"1","The Peppermill defies description.  Refined tackiness.  Utterly Craptastic.  Could it be that a Flamingo exploded in this place to give it the outragious pink hues?\n\nAll kidding aside, the best thing about this restaurant is the decor.  It screams cheesiness and vintage Vegas, with its faux neon lights and the veritable faux forest.  When was the last time you saw a deciduous tree in the middle of the desert?  I love the decor, and make sure that I always step into the lounge, open 24 hours a day, to see the fire and water fountain as well as the cocktail servers in the evening gowns split up to...here.\n\nNow to the substance.  Peppermill is an institution.  It has been around seeming forever, and had a scene from \""Casino\"" filmed there with Sharon Stone.\n\nThe food is average, at best.  It is also overpriced.  The place is best on its breakfast foods, in my humble opinion.  The omelets are huge, but again, overpriced.\n\nThe appetizer sampler platter is good, but overpriced.  Oddly enough, the onion rings on the appetizer platter are different than the onion rings as a side item.\n\nI recommend this place for drinks in the lounge, and for breakfast on the weekends if you are staying on the Strip.  The place, while overpriced, is still cheaper than the buffet.  And more fun.\n\nAre you noticing a trend here?  I will hit you over the head with it one more time...overpriced."
"2","Overall the food is pretty good. Worth going back. Flavorful and moist. I've been here multiple times and it's consistent. I think being consistent is one of the most important attributes of a restaurant. You can't have a great time one time and not the other. This place is better than good but don't go in with the expectation of great."
"2","Quite delicious for brunch. I am not normally a sweet breakfast food person, however the buckwheat waffle with a mimosa seems to be a perfect combination."
"2","Went to Lao Laan-Xang for lunch on a quiet Saturday and had a delightful meal. My order was for one vegetarian egg roll as an appetizer, the Gang Gallie curry with chicken, and jasmine tea.\n\nThe egg roll took a while to get out to me, but was hot and fresh. It was fat but not overstuffed, filled with cabbage, carrot and some other vegetables along with a good taste of seasoning. The wrap wasn't under-cooked on the on the inside like so many other egg rolls I've tried. I'm pretty sure the sweet & sour that came with was homemade, but it was so light in flavor it was unnoticeable against the bold seasoning of the egg roll itself. Kind of a shame, really.\n\nThe Gang Gallie was a yellow curry and coconut milk base with chicken, green beans, potato, onion, Thai eggplant, and what I think was acorn squash -- it definately wasn't carrot as it said on the menu. They served it in the ceramic cooking vessel and the portion size was incredibly generous. A massive bowl of white rice was served alongside for ultimate carb overload effect. It may have cost $11.95 on the menu, but I was able to take home enough to make a second meal. The curry was very nice; all the vegetables were cooked just right and the flavor of the vegetables came through the spice.\n\nMy jasmine tea was good. Enough said. =o)\n\nAs far as spiciness goes, I had ordered the curry at spice level 4. On the menu this is described as \""Native Lao\"" and I think that's accurate; you could eat this continuously without \""overheating\"", so to speak. They're not trying to hurt you. It's spicy, but not crazy...if you are comfortable with spicy food, order at a 4. It's not overpowering.\n\nService was attentive and nice. It's a small restaurant, so only one cook and one waitstaff was on duty. The food came out slowly but not unbearably so. Lao Laan-Xang was quite fairly priced and the food was good. If you haven't been, it's worth the visit."
"1","Bland, uninspired, mushy.\n\nI had 2 fish and 1 bean taco. The beans were good - the rest of the tacos, not so much! They were kind of slopped together. No fountain drinks - cans and bottles only. So much for being eco-friendly hippies."
"1","I've been here twice and I just don't think it's any good. For the money there are much better sandwich shops. The customer service was fine, the store was clean and nicely decorated but the food was just average to a little below average."
"2","I took my car in for an oil change after another place told me I needed to book a week in advance (Not possible for me, my schedule changes every single week) so I happened to stop by, since my dad had taken my car here forever ago. Not only were they super nice, they were able to squeeze me in as a walk in since someone else hadn't showed for their appointment! The only thing they told me when I came back to pick it up was that I needed my tires aligned. I had just changed the tires somewhere else, and they said the same thing, so I know they weren't just trying to upsell me. When I explained that I planned on selling my car soon, they were so honest and said \""I wouldn't even bother then, its not enough that it'll affect you short term\"" \nI always appreciate honesty on things like this, especially being a younger girl who knows next to nothing about cars. And as it turns out, I decided to keep my car and I will definitely be back to have my tires aligned!!"
"2","Good food, good service, nice selection of food... what more can one ask for? Didn't try the desserts, but they sounded yummy. There were four of us and each of us enjoyed our meal immensely. Will definitely be back."
"1","CAUTION! You should ALWAYS avoid this location. Sadly, this is the only US Postal office near my house. At first glance, it appears as though you happened to wonder in to pick up your package at an intensely busy time. You see the line out the door and you decide to come back later... Later comes around and guess what?? There is STILL a huge line! This place is always busy. Even the automated system always has a line of at least 7 people. \n\nToday was the best visit. I waited in line for 30 minutes for the automated system, only to learn they were out of stamps. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra 10 minutes driving to another postal location or use FedEx. \n\nThis location is the reason I have added the post office to my 100 reasons I hate being a grown up list. It was inserted between shaking strangers hands (germs) and waiting in line at Wal-Mart (Creepy Men & Germs)."
"2","What a cool experience. \n\nKinda like subway or chipotle for pizza. \n\nYou pick the sauce, cheese type & toppings. \n\nAnd then they cook it in their pizza oven. \nVery fresh and delicious. \n\nThe staff were very friendly and the restaurant is super clean. \n\n$22 for a family of 3. \n\n\nI will be back"
"2","Free wing Fridays... oh yeah.  I don't even like wings usually, but Silky's knows how to cook 'em so they don't taste fatty.  Get a side of Atomic sauce, which is flavorful as well as hot.  I'd buy it by the bottle if I could.  The menu is huge, and everything I've had has been good.  I always get the home fries on the side, which are cooked with onions and fried jalapenos (!).  Great waitresses, too.  Would be five stars if it had decent air conditioning--in the summer, sitting inside is painful."
"2","The ultimate Cirque du Soleil show.  \n\nWould be hard to see any Cirque show after this one.  Amazing"
"2","Better selection and prices than ABC. State Line had unique items like taster sets and hard-to-find bottles. I was surprised to see their extensive mini selection. If you are in the area, stop by and check them out!"
"2","Yummy food, awesome service tonight by Michael. Best service that we've received in a long time. Only complaint was that the salad dressing was extremely salty. Other than that, everything was perfect."
"1","If they ACTUALLY  went to school rather than getting their license from some backyard fake bs place they would KNOW that prosisasis is not a communicable disease and CANNOT be passed on from one person to the next. Psoriasis is the FIRST disease you learn about in school. Did they go? No! I'm a ACTUAL nail tech trying to get pampered for once rather than doing the pampering. I ACTUALLY went to school for this stuff. Unbelievable. They told my ex-wife that they wouldn't be able to do her pedicure because they don't want it getting passed to other people."
"1","Perhaps my order was off...I ordered the Schezuan tacos. I don't know why. I'm usually down to try some funky creation or rendition of Latin food, but it just wan't working. I need to learn to stick to what I know. Venturing out the box is always going to be a hit or miss. That day... it was a miss. \n\nThe salsas and chips were aight too. It wasn't memorable enough for me to comment on. \n\nMy regular lunch crew didn't comment on the food at all. We just went on about our business sharing the goss. Perhaps I ordered the wrong thing. Maybe I'll take a gander at the reviews again and go with a selection that has been deemed popular by the masses, based on all the good reviews. \n\nUntil next time..."
"2","Love the food - great kebabs! Especially lamb. Raspberry chicken dish - delicious. Service is excellent. Owner is devoted to the quality of food and enjoyment of customers. He is often there to greet customers! Great atmosphere - great music. Great hummus! Oh - and try the dumplings! yum yum!"
"1","I used to think this place was fantastic, until I realized what a rip off and a scam Planet Beach is. \n\nAfter paying a monthly fee for many months and not using all of my monthly credits I decided I was going to cancel my membership. They informed me that if I wanted to keep my accrued credits, I would have to continue a membership.\n\nNot wanting to lose my credits, I chose a lower level membership. I was told that I had the same access to all the services. Not true. After going back one time on the lower level membership I noticed additional service charges. Fine ok, guess I won't be utilizing the particular service anymore.\n\nAfter being out of town for a couple of weeks, I got a call today that my monthly payment didn't go through for Feb. My credit card was a part of the Target scam and in January  I was issued a new card, and then again in February when they did a second round of cards. I was informed when the manager called me that a late fee had been assessed to my account because of the lack of payment. I asked to have that removed. Out of the variety of different payments this month that had issues due to the credit card fraud, Planet Beach has been the only company that has not removed their late payment or lack of payment fees. I told the manager that I would not be paying the late fee, and she processed my card anyways. I am more than willing to pay my obligation of the monthly fee, but not a late fee that's from something out of my control.\n\nI will be marching down there today to cancel my membership. Which after reading reviews on here, I now realize will take me 60 days. What a joke."
"2","I was apprehensive about coming here for a Naked and Famous show just because of all the horrible reviews I read on here about it. In all honesty, I think the venue was actually pretty great. We arrived early so we had no issues getting our will call tickets or finding parking ($7). The stage/standing area was clean and well-maintained. Since I arrived early, I was able to stand near the front and be very close to the band. It's an intimate setting and I think as far as a venue for a concert goes, this place exceeded my expectations."
"1","I was charged over $230 for a \""touch up\"" color. My hair ended up brown (of which I specifically said no brown), I went back to have it  fixed, was charged $65 for a haircut I did not want and my hair was changed from brown to bright orange. When I asked for a partial refund (keep tips and haircut money), I was told that I should go back and have it fixed again. Now, I am out over $300. This place has no policy for \""refunds\"" or disatisfaction, you're just supposed to keep going back over and over until it's \""fixed\"". If you are unlucky and have a bad experience, too bad for you. I had to go to a different salon to have my hair corrected."
"2","Food is very good. Great portion s for the price. Very fast service as well. This is my go to place for lunch during the week."
"1","Sadly I'm giving them a 1 star because I sat there for 10 minutes (while writing this review) before walking out! I realize it was later in the afternoon but to be completely ignored for that long (when the restaurant isn't even busy) is ridiculous! \n\nI love this place back home in CO so when I saw that we had one in PHX I was ecstatic! \n\nI hope they don't treat all their \""lunch\"" hour guests that way!!!"
"1","OMG....last night was a nightmare. We were (not) served by the most incompetent server,who was rivaled in his rudeness and seconded by the manager on duty.  Two drinks ordered were unavailable as there was none of the requested mixer( orange juice and 7up, or Sierra mist)\nWe waited (me without a beverage) for 35 minutes for our pizza (they were not overly busy) at which point we enquired of the manager as to when it might be expected.  He disappeared and returned several mi urea later to inform us that it would take another 25 to 35 minutes. We left!.... avoid this restaurant. Grimaldis in Old Town, Scottsdale is fabulous.  Go there .   Had to give it 1 star, but it actually this particular store deserves zero.  Get a new manager and fire the bald waiter."
"1","Quite disappointing. The hotel is undergoing a major refurbishment and in all honestly should have closed its doors during the construction. \n\nThere is no lobby, instead it is just a trailer (yes a trailer albeit with nice carpets). To access your room you have to navigate a labyrinth of hallways and multiple lifts (3 separate lifts!). After an long day at the festivals I was annoyed to have to walk another 10-15 minutes in the hotel to get to my room. Yes, the rooms are very plush and well furnished and the beds are comfy, however, there were quite a few things that went awry that really are not acceptable for a place that charges over 350 pounds/night for a standard room. \n\nFor instance the phone in the room was busted, the sink facet was blocked, the maids would jam up the music when they clean adjacent rooms (annoying on a early Sunday morning). Even operating the lights requires a masters degree (I could make the bathroom appear blue or purple but couldn't get them to stay on). All in, really poor showing by a starwood property. Perhaps this will change when the construction ends, but for now avoid."
"2","really great stuff. the sides are really big and delicious, steak is top notch. the bread the start you off with is melt in your mouth good, try not to eat too much, the portions here are very big. the lobster bisque and the french onion soup are awesome. there is a server named sue she is the best!"
"1","Horrible food. The fish was extremely oily, as well as the fries. Never going back. The food was tasteless and dry."
"2","I highly recommend this to place to other tapas lovers. We had a 50 dollar dinning credit for Aria and picked the best reviewed restaurant here. We spent well over that and it was worth it! \n\nWe began our meal with a their version of sangria made with Spumante, (usually red or white wine is used) but it I was excited as it had my favorite kind of champagne. Sweet, fruity and not overly dry. It was light and refreshing but contained very little fruit perhaps due to being served in a small champagne flutes. The tuna tar tare cones were amazing! The light and airy crunchy cones they came in provided for a wonder contrast with the tuna which melted in our mouths. The dates wrapped in bacon and stuffed with goat cheese, were phenomenal as were and the breaded manchego cheese pops. Whitefish ceviche was yum but we wished there were more taro chips to go with it. Yellowtail was just eh. \n\nWe finished up the meal with simple but delicious donut holes with butterscotch sauce and a very nice port wine. It was a perfect combination and end to a superb meal. Our server Donovan provided excellent service and was very attentive yet unobtrusive. He provided wonderful descriptions of items offered and he was very helpful with recommendations when we had questions on what was best to order."
"2","Simply outstanding.\n\nSimple decor.  Knowledgeable bartenders.  Calm atmosphere.  Old school jazz.  And most importantly world-class cocktails.\n\nThey have a cool cocktail list on the wall featuring 6-8 creations form cocktail guru Dale DeGroff who I understand had a hand in starting the bar.  Also there is a huge cocktail bible on the bar so you can order just about anything your heart desires.  The key to any great cocktail bar is being able to rely on the recommendations of the bartenders, and Embury was definitely on point.  The most interesting drink of the night was the Faust's Pact that was made with muddled jalapenos, though everything was very good.\n\nNext time I'm in Pittsburgh, I'd definitely go out of my way to make a stop by Embury for a couple cocktails."
"1","This is hard to review.  The reason being is that I knew it was a tourist trap and it was just a huge gimmick.  That being said, I knew what to expect.\n\nLet me explain prices and such.  You pay $25.  To get in and for a drink voucher.  You go in and it's a pretty tiny refridgerator.  With ice benches and such.  THE NAKED STATUE IS GONE!  NO TITTY SUCKING PREVS!  (OK, we wanted to do that too...)\n\nThis place is huge on taking your money.  No cameras allowed like the others have mentioned.  Their excuse is that electronics go bad under that weather.  Not true.  A photographer comes in to take pictures, with a regular camera.  You can buy pics for about $20 each after.\n\nIt's not too cold to be honest.  So don't worry about getting extra coats or wahtever, save your money.  You're paying enough to walk into a fridge.\n\nIt was cool to go to though.  Once in a lifetime thing."
"1","I was craving pasta and I wanted a quick fix, so I decided to come here. Biggest mistake ever. \n\nI ordered the Broccoli Pesto with angel hair pasta. Absolutely disgusting. It tasted like I was just taking bites out of raw garlic cloves. The garlic was so strong, it literally made my eyes water. \n\nThe pasta was cooked fine and the chicken was okay, if only I was able to actually taste the broccoli pesto, and not just clumps of garlic.\n\nThis hasn't been my first time here. I've order a few other times, and everything else that I've ordered in the past has always been bland, dry, and tasteless. \n\nAfter this experience, I probably will never go back...Unless my pasta craving is a do or die situation. I'll just have to learn how to be patient and cook my own pasta from now on."
"1","The burgers are not close to what i would describe as good. The meat was overcooked and it was a round ball of meat, which made it fall apart. \nThe fries where okay and the beer selection was good."
"1","Wow!!! Very upsetting. Got greeted great and that's where it ended. Sat us at our table. Waited over 7 mins and not one person even came over to our table. Got up and left. Told the nice girl at the front, she tried to get us back to sit down but I wasn't about to return after waiting. If you are going to charge that kind of money for your food, your service better be top notch. Not what I expected for a Gordon Ramsey restaurant. I know it's a Saturday night at 11 but you should give the same service no matter what time it is. I hope this is not normal. I would like to try it again maybe sometime."
"2","This place has changed hands (and names) 3 times in the last three years, so when Malones took over from The Fat Cow I really didn't see it lasting that long. But I was wrong!\n\nThe inside looks like the standard Irish pub, with lots of dark wood and green and beige d\u00e9cor, but they've quirked it up a bit by painting famous quotes about all things Irish all over the walls which kept me entertained when my friend had nipped off to the loo. We perched in one of the high booths in the window, which offered a prime people-watching vantage point, but they have a whole load of sofas and tables throughout the huge downstairs area to choose from.\n\nDrinks are roughly \u00a33-4, which is more exensive than a lot o other bars in the area, but the service was fast and the beer was cold, so I didn't mind. We were only there for a few quiet afternoon drinks, but I've heard that it gets really lively in the evenings and from what I saw advertised they have regular ceilidh nights and live music evenings, which I will be sampling soon..."
"1","We always wanted to go this place due to the fact that many other Hong Kong Chinese restaurants are really good and it seem like it was like a great authentic Chinese food place to go to.  This is by far the worst place i have ever been. \n I ordered the egg fu yung, it came with 3 patties, just green onions on top and gravy. no other vegetables or other condiments like I have at other places and worst of all it was burnt.\n We ordered Peking Pork Chops and it tasted like orange chicken, try figure. \nAnd last we ordered Seafood Chow fun, it was slimy and seafood was chewy, uncooked and no flavor what so ever.  \nThe top it all off, we were not offered any other drinks, server just gave us water that tasted so bad due to the fact probably because the glass cups were not washed well as you could see other lip stains. We all felt grossed out and sick after and my 3 year old daughter was nauseated  all the way home.  Me and my wife had a headache as well. Probably because, i presumed of the MSG and uncooked seafood and the overcooked egg fu yung.  \nLast, it was 105 degrees outside and I was sweating like a pig inside with there ceiling fans off and the A/C prob seem like it was set at 90 degrees.\nFirst and last time at this place."
"1","OK, I am not a shopper...by no means! But, as part of the activities for a small family get together in Vegas, I agreed to go along. I had no idea what to expect but had heard that there was this great new mall in vegas.\n\nLet me preface this slam of a review by saying it was the end of June in Vegas which means it was hot, but not yet Vegas (read: Africa) Hot yet. I think it was about 100-102.\n\nSo, the backers of this project must have picked their architect from a pool of guys passing around a massively packed water pipe. \n\nWHO BUILDS AN OUTDOOR MALL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FREAKIN' DESERT!\n\nSomeone should have told the guy that most people in the USA go to the mall to GET OUT OF THE HEAT. \n\nNow, add to this that instead of one main thoroughfare like the outdoor mall in SLC (The Gateway), this place has side streets and the sight lines and the signage makes it impossible to see what stores are where. Between the heat and the need for a GPS to navigate this place, most people must go to one or two stores they know they need to go to, then pack it up and head out.\n\nNow, they did have misters here and there, but the ones that did work did not do much as they were 10' off the ground and the water evaporated too high off the ground. The real kicker is the kids play area (which was quite nice) had very little shade and NO MISTERS! Top that off with the water feature in the kids area was not even working!\n\nIn the end, the best part of my trip to this mall was leaving the group behind, driving across the parking lot, and exploring the nice air-conditioned realm of Fry's!"
"2","chicken fried steak, biscuits, hash.... all in an authentic diner setting.   Perfect."
"1","La bi\u00e8re est tr\u00e8s d\u00e9cevante pour le prix (ex: 13$ pour une grosse bi\u00e8re a 7% qui goutais l'eau et qui donnais mal au coeur). Quand je suis all\u00e9e, j'ai pris un fish'n'ship a la bi\u00e8re pensant que ce serais dans leur sp\u00e9cialit\u00e9 de microbrasserie. Je n'ai jamais manger un aussi mauvais poisson pann\u00e9...il y avait a peine de poisson et trop de panure mal cuite. De plus, les frites surgel\u00e9s \u00e9taient tr\u00e8s ordinaires!!! Je ne pense pas y retourner!"
"1","Last night I had THE WORST movie experience of my life. I'm better off just listing everything one by one\n1. The wait to get into this place was probably longer than any concert I've ever been to. You would've thought there was a celebrity inside or something. I was with my sister and we were in our car waiting for 50 minutes to get in. There is only one way out and its forwards thru the cashier's booth at the end so we were stuck with no option but to keep moving forward. \n2. Despite arriving early before the movie was supposed to even show we decided to stay (since we waited so long) and watch the last half of the movie until the next showing. The only reason we did this was because the drive GETTING OUT was just as bad as getting in. \n3. There is no organization whatsoever as far as the layout goes, drive roads, or overall theater layout. The theaters were so packed close together that I could hear the dialogue from every single movie playing. We were that close to each other. \n4. In the same note, parking in the theater lot was next to impossible because the space was not properly utilized. It was a free for all parking scenario. Drive thru's when I was a kid had properly marked spots (like any parking lot) this place had none.  Once we parked we basically got locked in behind an enormous van that blocked half the screen. Not only should the theater lots should be properly marked but should probably be on a sloop to ensure everyone can see the screen. \n5. At the end of the first showing (which we missed half of, remind you) as soon as cars started leaving we moved closer to the screen to ensure a better view. Awesome, right? WRONG! Didn't matter where we parked because there were screaming, yelling children running amok. the noise level from neighbor cars was just outright annoying not to mention we could still hear the noise from the other movies. Should there not be walls, gates or something acting a sound barrier between each theater? \n6. The second showing of the movie was supposed to start at 10:30 (because we had missed the first half of the first showing we were going to stay and wait to see the second showing) but it didn't start till about 11:20 and even then we had no warning until 11:10 We had the station they played the audio for the movie on the whole time. Between movies they played indie which is fine but it wasn't until 11:20 that we got an announcement on the radio from the theater employees saying they sorry for the inconvenience but because there were people still waiting to get in the theater that the movie would be starting late.\n7. About the last 20 minutes of the film it just cut off. NOTHING no MOVIE! The screen went completely blank and people started honking like crazy. Understandable, however, extremely annoying. It did start back up again after a few minutes but at the beginning of the previews then it went back out again. \n8. At that point we decided to just leave. As we drove silently away we became very confused as to where the exit was because people apparently were parked in the poorly paved/marked road that led to the exit. We had to drive our car thru a labyrinth of parked cars, people in seats and children running around. Of course we got dirty looks from people because.\nEven with the cheap ticket prices (they only take cash) double feature options (which we didn't use but were excited to know about going in) and the comfort of our own car and snacks (we never bothered with the concession stand, we're not that adventurous) there was absolutely NO redeeming qualities and I would not suggest going to this place unless they do a complete overhaul of EVERYTHING."
"2","Ate here for the first time this morning at 11:15 a.m.  As A.B. guessed, they are primarily a catering gig.  There were only two other parties there. The family ordered off of the menu--eggs Benedict, patty melt, and 2 your way.  I ordered the skillet, as advertised on the window.\n\nI've eaten at most of the breakfast joints around town. Add this place to the list of good ones. Potatoes and eggs were perfect, the portions are huge, and everything came out about the same time. Service is attentive, and friendly.  Check out the pics of the Benedict and skillet--we'll be eating this for tomorrow's breakfast!"
"2","Ein zentraler Punkt, um auf die Schnelle den Hunger oder Durst zu stillen. Preislich f\u00fcr die Lage ok und aufgrund der \u00fcbersichtlichen Besucherzahl auch eine gute Bedienung.\n\nDas bestellte (Latte und Waffeln mit Sauerkirschen) waren im oberen Drittel des durchschnittlichen."
"2","This is a great hotel but they have been raising the rates through the roof lately (and I'm not sure the new prices are worth it)! I love how gorgeous everything is - the decorations are impeccable - but I was able to stay in a corner suite at the Aria next door for less than a standard room at the Cosmopolitan my last trip. Needless to say, given the choice, I'd stay in the corner suite every time. \n\nBut the Cosmopolitan staff is super friendly and even if you don't stay here, I'd definitely recommend walking through (especially if you are with a bachelorette party - all those sparkles!). I love the chandeliers and casino. They also have great restaurants and a very cool pool. Hopefully they will stop price gouging and I can stay there again."
"1","We went downstairs for the Sunday brunch compliments of the 2 free buffet coupons received as part of our postcard offer.   The brunch proved to be, as expected, a disappointment with everything of mediocre quality.  I sampled shrimp cocktail, Mongolian grilled chicken and vegetables, chow fun and (3) itty bitty desserts.  I felt it was overpriced because of the lack of variety and quality in comparison to their regular breakfast buffet."
"2","I have dined in at Abuelo's once and eaten their take-out at least three times.  I have to admit, this restaurant doesn't do much for me. I think this is because I'm a vegetarian and there just isn't much on the menu for me.   Tonight I had their cheese and onion enchiladas, which were perfectly fine...but I wasn't wowed. Why then, you ask, am I giving them a 4-star review? Well, because it seems as though everyone else who has dined with me has really enjoyed their food. I have not heard a single complaint from anyone else who has eaten at Abuelo's. Their chips and salsa are great - the chips are light and airy with the perfect amount of salt and the salsas taste very fresh and, as a person who doesn't love salsa, I think they are pretty awesome.  My friend who was born and raised in Mexico said everything he tried was really flavorful and good - he clearly knows better than I do.  When I dined in, our server was wonderful, a funny young man (that makes me sound really old) who was did a great job with a bunch of half drunk 30-something women. So, while Abuelo's probably wouldn't be MY first pick of a dinner restaurant, it has proven time and time again that it is, overall, a quality restaurant for those who have more choices on the menu."
"1","The start is for atmosphere, food is awful. No flavor whatsoever. Drinks are over priced . I was expecting a good Margarita for 13 dollars but it was just like the food. No flavor. I will not come back nor recommend anyone ."
"1","The food was all right. But the service was horrible.  We went there with a group of 16 for my sister's 30th birthday. It was fine when we first got there but one of our people was in a wheelchair and thus made the night worse. First they wouldn't out a short 4 top in the section by the long high top(where we were). Then the manager refused to put enough tables together as we needed to keep them for other guests.  We were all eating and drinking.  No one was just sitting drinking water. So it was horribly awkward. The waitress was slow and inefficient. We got drinks one at a time and food was so slow some people finished before the others had their wings. No one knew where ye food went though the server wrote in order what we wanted. Meals were messed up. But worst of all we had to go to the bar to refill our water and sweet tea because NO ONE would come refill our glasses. The manager made us unwelcome though we spent hundreds of dollars. It was my first and last trip to this place. No thank you."
"2","Tuesdays are all night happy hours (when one ends, the reverse begins), and Mondays and Thursdays after 6:30 they have a collection of 1/2 off rolls.\n\nCan't speak too much for the drink specials because I always get their signature saketini, which is made with absolut and some green tea liqeuor. I highly recommend this drink because it's smooth, slightly sweet, and has that nice green tea flavor I just love.\n\nWe're pretty boring when it comes to rolls--got the crispy california, the shrimp tempura and the firecracker, which was a jumbo jalepeno popper with spicy crab in it. Oh man, it was all glorious. I've had the spicy tuna there also, and the dragon. It's all good to me.\n\nThey always have some crazy creation on the sushi board and the staff is always friendly. You're better off sitting at the bar--we go for games--as it seems the servers are more attentive there (or at least they're always back there doing stuff).\n\nTry it, and keep a business alive."
"1","This is the first time I've eaten here. Before this was called wok in. Great food and owner was amazing. This here is a complete and utter dissapointment. The food lacks everything decent. Orange chicken well over cooked. The pad Thai flavorless. The Singapore noodle flavorless and lacking most if the ingredients that you expect to find in this dish. 2 stars is being nice and giving this establishment a chance.. But or now, I'll stick with the place that sells dumplings that are little off of Stephanie and horizon."
"1","First time here, for breakfast.... Was thinking to find something else besides IHOP & Denny's ..... Obviously this place need to call Robert Irvine! Smell old , look old , oily everything you touch .... I have a chance to try anyway because of \"" good yelp reviews\"" MISTAKE!!!! Server was sooooo rude, she needs to be \""trained\"" of customer service speak abilities ..... I bet they did not see much nice dressed up people. Ok, food.... Home made potatoes were good, omelet sooooo plain! Do they have at least black pepper? Ok, 1 star for potato...."
"1","I probably should've read the reviews that were written post grand re-opening, but instead, I figured that DD had to be better than I remembered.  Not the case!\n\nI stopped by this location this morning thinking about a coffee and maybe a breakfast sandwich.  Unfortunately, they were out of eggs!  Out of eggs?  Are you kidding me?  Ok... then I glanced at the muffin selection for an alternative.  No bran muffins or corn muffins (my two favorites).  That sucks!  So, I ordered an iced coffee with sugar-free vanilla flavoring and left in a flurry.  I took a sip and it was pretty gross - way too much syrup!  I came home, dumped half of it out, added some soy milk and it's now at least drinkable.\n\nNeedless to say, not so impressed with the new (and not so improved) DD!"
"2","I've gone here twice now. This place rocks because: (1) great beer selection; (2) super friendly and helpful bartenders/waitresses; (3) basic food at a fair price; (4) pool tables, shuffle board, darts, loungey area; (5) tons of TV's; (6) location - right across from hardrock in the same parking lot as the new Kiss mini-put-put park.  This is my new preferred Friday after work happy hour spot.  Highly recommend grabbing a few cold ones before golfing at the Kiss park (locals discount- $10 to play).  Love it!"
"1","I won't 'star' this review yet. I ordered online today (12/22/11) and it's been over an hour and the food isn't here. It was supposed to be delivered by 12:30 and it's after 1 right now. They did call to tell me brown rice costs a dollar more per order which wasn't reflected on the site. \nAlready we're off to a bad start but I will eat with an open mind. Be back eventually after lunch.\nK, back. The food was good but no where near warm enough to fully enjoy. I ordered the Panang Chicken very spicy and it barely was. They also screwed up some parts of the order. I figured they were busy because of a lunch rush, but if you can't get the online ordering down pat, remove it as an option. Seriously, an extra goddam dollor for a penny's worth of brown rice? I won't be back, sorry Thai house."
"1","Pros\n- Tasty appetizers\n- Creative and balance martinis\n\nCons\n- Way too pricey\n- Snooty wait staff\n\nMy waiter acted like he was doing me a favour serving me. Everything came with a sigh and a face. Regardless of the food and drink, I won't go back because I simply didn't feel welcomed there. My friends and I wanted to continue our night so we just crossed the parking lot to Jack Astor's, where we felt the staff were happy to have our business."
"2","I park at Aaron's as often as possible. I only didn't give it 5 stars due to lack of space. They really should look into expanding.  Having that bouncer Lincoln does keep everyone in line so even though it's crowded no one gets out of control. I've met some really great people here. Will definitely keep coming back."
"1","Huge portions / poor quality.  Basically all of the buffets in the Rio are horrible and, of course, quite expensive.  You are better off eating at the Mediterranean or the Asia restaurants.  Not cheap, but excellent quality."
"2","I have read many unfair reviews of this restaurant. It appears many people are attempting to \""double dip\"". If you buy a groupon, don't be a cheapo and expect that the sushi half off will apply to you and then you can also get to apply your groupon. How do you expect these people to live? \nOutside of the misers that are reviewing this restaurant everybody should know the following:\n1) The sushi is amazing. I have seen some really innovative stuff.\n2) The owners are amazing. They are super friendly and, if you have children, they are kind to your children. It is not every day that you find that in a sushi restaurant. \n3) They will accommodate you. If you are a sushi fanatic like myself and like something that is not on the menu, ask and you shall receive.\nAll of these reasons combine to make this my FAVORITE sushi place in Phoenix."
"1","Overall was very disappointed as on a previous stay we were at the Mirage and paid far less for a much nicer room.\n\nChecked in and were given a room on the 3rd floor, south side of the building. Room was clean but just had a dirty vibe. Window view was of a loading dock and there were water stains on the window coverings. Stopped at front desk later in the evening and was told to call after 11a for a new room. In the morning we were moved to the East side of the building, 11th floor. Room had a better view and wasn't as shabby. TVs were not flat screen in either and there is no wireless. Cell signal inside (ATT) was crappy too.\n\nCasino floor looked to have been updated - staff was friendly.\n\nThe inclined elevators are truly a marvel. Wish they had a see-thru one.\n\nPool area was clean and there are a lot of paid areas if you want a bit more privacy. DJ was spinning tunes starting at about 11a on Saturday.\n\nI'd stay here again for $39/nt but if you're paying hundreds like we did, spend a few more and stay elsewhere."
"1","Food is great but service, not so good. Left my debit card which the server promptly turned in but when I called 3 hours later, the hostess quickly advised no cards had been left at lunchtime. It took my driving to the East Blvd location to have the bartender check the cash drawer to locate the card AND remember the server turning it over to her at lunchtime. Cost me a lot of time and agony!"
"1","NEVER AGAIN! I have been looking for a new nail salon since I moved to a different area of town. I get a mani/pedi every week. A lady at work suggested I try Polished. I am going to Hawaii this week and wanted to do gel since it will stay better for my vacation. I called yesterday 4/30/12 to make an appointment. I asked for a gel manicure and gel pedicure. The girl who answered the phone was clearly rushed and was not listening to me as I had to repeat myself several times and she kept talking to someone named Lily. She asked if I needed just a gel polish change and I said no I need a manicure too. When I arrived Brianna was at the desk and I double checked what she scheduled me for (figured given my phone conversation, I should probably verify) she told me I was scheduled for a gel manicure. I told her I had also scheduled a gel pedicure. She doubled checked the computer and said \""oh ya I see it now, you were just scheduled with 2 different people so I didn't see it at first\"". Ok, no problem, I understand that. My appointment was at 6:15pm. At 6:25 I was seated at a pedicure station, I was ok with waiting I know things run late sometimes. The guy started my pedicure and he then asked what color I wanted. I showed him and he said he couldn't do that one because it was a gel color. I know, that is what I scheduled. He went to the counter and talk to Brianna. She rudely said \""she can't have that\""??? \n\nWhy not? That is what I scheduled.  He came back to me and said he couldn't do it because they didn't have a technician and according to their books I only scheduled a regular pedicure and maybe I could come back tomorrow for a polish change (which I would have to pay an additional $25 for).\n\nNot possible. I specifically asked for the gel because of my upcoming vacation. I even verified with Brianna when I arrived about it yet now she rudely states \""she can't have it?\"" \n\nAnyway, so I had to get a regular pedicure which was....basic. not to mention I left there with rough feet, something that has never happened after a pedicure.\n\nAfter the pedicure I was told to go up front to wait for my manicure. When i went up to the counter the other counter girl who was very nice asked me about the service. I was mid answer and Brianna yells at me \""I'm taking you to your manicure\"" I told her I was just answering the question of her co worker and Brianne rudely told me that I needed to just follow her. I was asked a question by the staff and I am cut off mid sentence like a child as if I was doing something wrong? She seats me and I have to wait about 10 minutes for the tech, so why couldn't I have finished my conversation with her co worker? Brianna was rude to both customers and staff, many times of which staff commented on. \n\nAnyway, every manicure I have ever received included nail prep (shaping, filing, etc.) as well as lotion and hand rub etc. apparently at Polished a manicure is JUST filing your nails (which my really didn't need) and polish. Seriously? \n\nIcing on the cake? The girl next to me getting her nails done decided she wanted a gel pedicure too, but didn't have an appointment. Brianna sent a technician right over to do her toes. I couldn't have gel which I made an appointment, for because they were too busy but the girl next to me can?\n\nIn the end, $80 later, I will say this: Nail Salons are a dime a dozen in Las Vegas.  Service is EVERYTHING and I am not even a very picky person when it comes to service. HOWEVER, I will NEVER return to Polished specifically based on the very rude way I was treated by BRIANNA. As I mentioned, I get my nails and toes done every week. I don't know if Brianna is the receptionist, manager, or owner but I will NEVER go back because of her and you can bet I will never recommend Polished because of her."
"2","Honestly, i am surprised by some of the reviews...\n\n Great food. Great service. Jason was our server and made our experience very fun! Great price point for the strip as well. \n\nWe will be back!"
"1","this place is on the opposite side of the of the I-15, away from the strip. it's located right next to a Big Lots and a Lucky's supermarket. in an area where all the other asian establishments are in LV. Vegas chinatown you could say.\n\nwe've tried a few other pho places in the area, but for some reason we keep coming back to this one. it's your run of the mill pho place, nothing special. pretty much the pho joint that you'd find anywhere else.\n\nthe one major minus of this place is the fact that the pho takes FOREVERS to come out. usually when you order a bowl of pho anywhere else. it comes out right away. for some strange reason, it takes soooooooooo long for it to come out here. \n\nI mean come on.. \n\n1)  broth? pre-made. \n2) noodles? pre-made.\n3) meat? all ready and chopped up.\n\nwhat the hell is taking so long?? throw it all in a bowl, pour the broth and serve while it's still hot! no need to make us wait 20+ minutes. i'm still slightly drunk and hung over. i want my damn bowl of pho! what the hell are you guys doing back there, gambling!? well... viet people do love to gamble, and it is vegas..."
"1","I had a super rude cashier made a huge fuss over a exchange of a broken item. I would have bought but because of her rudeness I did my exchange and left I didn't get her name but on my receipt it says cashier 1271421"
"2","Very friendly bunch. Great service!"
"2","Service at your seat!! =D Food and drinks!! Beer and wine!! What else could you ask for!! The VIP room's is the way to go, with the huge cushy leather couch, privacy and did I mention no inconsiderate patrons talking or eating in your ear!! Your next special occasion you got to give it a try! \n\nWe got a sneak peek on how they prepare their flavored popcorn, I could'nt believe it was made there! Too bad there is not one in Californina I guess I need to go back out to visit the theater and have the best movie experience EVER!"
"2","Outstanding food quality and customer service by the waiter."
"1","Wir waren in den letzten Jahren ein paar Mal vor dem Kino in der Fritte. Das Essen haben wir bislang immer als sehr mittelm\u00e4\u00dfig empfunden - die Pommes sind selten knusprig.\n\n\n Beim letzten Besuch jedoch bekam ich die bestellten Chicken Nuggets innen ziemlich roh und damit absolut ungenie\u00dfbar. Meine Beschwerde nahmen die Mitarbeiterinnen hinter der Theke schon nicht besonders freundlich entgegen. Nein, der versprochene Ersatz wurde vollkommen vergessen.\n\n\n Auf meine Nachfrage beim Verlassen der Fritte hin wollte man mir noch schnell welche zum Mitnehmen mitgeben. Der Appetit war mir vergangen, zudem fing der Kinofilm bald an. Erstaunlich, dass es nicht mal f\u00fcr eine Entschuldigung gereicht hat.\n\n\n Mich sieht die Fritte als Kunden so schnell nicht wieder."
"1","I will not be returning. Both staff members that took care of me were very rough. The man doing my nails completely ripped up my cuticles and I still have pain and scabs 3 days later. He continually told me to relax my hand or he couldn't help from cutting me. Overall my nails and toes look ok, but the painful experience was enough to keep me from ever coming back."
"2","Amazing experience. View is incredible and the Bellagio dancing waters are the perfect scenery. Food was great. We order lamb and prime rib, both delicious. Great service. Our server was very attentive and on top of every detail to make our dinning experience superb! Pricey but worth every penny!"
"2","I had a great experience with the service department. Andy was my service advisor and i highly recommend him. \n\nEveryone says dealership charges too much for repairs. That is not always true. They charged me $200 less than any other independent BMW shop which also included  2 weeks of free BMW loaner car while they had my car in their shop and 2 years (unlimited miles) warranty.... can't beat that.\n\nThank you !"
"1","Miserable staff that works there. No thank yous for shopping at the store. Will never be back."
"1","Good ice cream but the pizza was just ok. Not terrible, but I'd take Vocelli or any other chain over it on any day."
"1","It's got it's ups and downs.  It's got a reasonably attractive interior, antique tin ceilings, a broad selection of dozens of beers and a tasty looking menu featuring daily specials.  So why my low score?  D's at the other end of the block puts their beer collection to shame offering 1000 beers,  Both times I've eaten here the wait to be served has been extremely slow (at least 30 minutes and up) the prices are a bit high ($10-$15 for a lunch entree) and most importantly the food is in general heavy and bland.  This is not a terrible place, but with so many delicious spots nearby in regent square like the green mango, map room, d's and the square cafe you should keep on walking.  That said, if you wanted a quiet spot to grab a beer with a friend, you could definitely do worse, but skip the boring food."
"2","Bought my 2008 TSX here, and loved the experience compared to other vehicles I've purchased.  I'm actually here now getting an oil change, which is a steal compared to other shops around town: 3 oil changes for $50!  Would much rather wait for my car to be serviced here... fridge full of free sodas and water, and usually they have snacks like bagels and donuts.  Very happy that they finally figured out that giving away wifi to their customers was a no-brainer."
"2","Recently I visited a handful of international food stores in Champaign, IL. Far East Market was the most impressive among them. Their Produce selection was incredible. A short list includes mangos, banannas, Korean pears, luffa, eggplant, casava, clabaza squash, lotus root, galanga, plantain, daikon, dirion, and many more. There was a variety of mushrooms. They offer very fresh seafood. Other items that were offered bananna blossom in brine, canned jack fruit, pickled caggage, bamboo shoots, quail eggs, fried gluten, dried lotus seeds and a variety of exotic teas. If you are looking for a more authentic selection of fresh foods, this is likely your best bet. The grocery store is rustic and it almost feels as though you step into an inner city market in another country when you visit Far East Market. They take both checks and cash but do NOT accept credit."
"2","I love the Encore!! This hotel is top notch! I can't wait to go stay there again. The rooms were so gorgeous and comfortable. I stayed in the Resort King Suite. The room was really classy and spacious. The bathroom had his and her sinks with a gorgeous glass shower.  The entire hotel was beautifully decorated with multicolored butterflies and red accents. The location was really convenient. You can walk across the street and go to the fashion show mall. You could also walk to the Venetian pretty easily. There is a very conveniently located bridge to the Venetian next to a beautiful waterfall. I had a fabulous time there. I suggest this hotel to anyone that wants to have a relaxing time in a nice hotel in Vegas. It is simply delightful."
"2","What a great find for dinner while on business in Vegas!\n\nThe inside is very calming and cool, and I LOVED how you could look in and see the chefs cooking in the centrally located kitchen with glass. Throughout the meal we even saw chefs running various food items to different kitchens.\n\nWe sat down and ordered some cocktails which we loved. I can't remember which ones we got, but they were girly and delicious and super fresh.\n\nThe different cuisines on the menu made it a great place to go to try a variety of things. We split the Pot Sticker appetizer (came with 5) and enjoyed them. For $18 the portion was probably a little small but we enjoyed non-the-less. We were nervous about portion size after this so my co-worker and I ordered 2 sides with our meals. The sides were HUGE. We had the Tempura Vegetables and the Brussels Sprouts - both excellent! We were sad we couldn't finish them as our entrees were delicious too.\n\nI ordered the Signature Braised Short Rib. The meal was beautifully presented (see my picture) and the meat fell apart so nicely. Co-worker had the Butternut Squash Ravioli which she loved as well.\n\nThe meal was definitely pricey but worth it if you want a nice dinner in a nice hotel and want a place with LOTS to choose from on the menu. There is definitely something for everyone!"
"2","They have the biggest collection of Alcoholic beverages at the least price in the entire world. B4 I went here I thought BevMo was the king of kings, but not anymore"
"2","Outstanding!  I was in Scottsdale for some golf and baseball. Threw my back out and was suffering. Looked like my weekend was ruined but I happened to find Thai Royal. Tara (sorry if name is misspelled) was a miracle worker. She worked on stretching my back and I was 100% better. Looks like I'll be golfing tomorrow :)\n\nThank you Tara and Thai Royal Massage!"
"1","They took forever to bring a waffle which should have came with the chicken the so called cooks were so busy bullshittin my waffle wasn't made until I went up to the counter and asked about it. One server worked and the other girl was completely use less. They have no since of urgency when it came to food prep they were to busy looking at this lady on her motorcycle that they clearly wouldn't have a chance with do your job please and thank you shit. Crazy part it wasnt busy."
"2","ohhh spicy and messy just how i love my burgers cant wait to go back again"
"1","Fuck this place it's shit. What a joke. How about adding some booze to the shitty margaritas. The 70 volt audio system is shit absolute shit.  Thanks for the shiity microwaved fish tacos and the reconstituted dog food quesadilla.  Fuck it."
"2","If there's something that I cannot find at any other supercenter, Target usually has it. This store is nice because it's clean, and still yet goes a bit unnoticed by people. It has a Starbucks and a food center, like all usually do. Their clothes section is also pretty great too, although a bit pricey. People are right when they say come to Target for more quality!"
"2","Very nice ambience, especially in the fall. \nLarge, mature trees line long fields with a pretty view of the south mountains. A quaint \""farm\"" setting with small gardens and little shops in shabby chic buildings. \n\nYou park across the street in a dirt/rock lot. Once you wander across the street, there is a cute little shack type set up, you walk in, grab your fresh made, plastic packed items. They have fresh and hearty salads with your choice of gourmet dressings, choices of sandwiches on artisan breads, delicious muffins and cake slices, all made right there. There are really cute miniature pies that look great, as well as fresh made lemonades that are really good. \n\nYou get your sandwiches (fresh made) in a little picnic basket, after you pay. Grab a seat in the fenced in garden and enjoy the views and the weather (if it's not too hot out). Many people bring their pups and enjoy a walk around the farm.\n\nI love this place, I love that everything is fresh and it always tastes great!\n\nPrices are very reasonable for the quality of food you are getting."
"1","Overrated.  Completely overrated.  \n\nI had read about this place in the Stip District magazine, so I thought I'd give it a try.  I was so disappointed with the donuts.  I don't understand what all the hype is about.  They were dry and no terribly flavorful.  I got three different varieties.  Definitely NOT worth the price.\n\nWon't be going back.  Ever."
"1","Yokoso... More like YUCK-oso.  We walked in on a busy Saturday night and sat at the sushi bar.  It took almost 10 minutes for our server to greet us. I ordered a Heineken, which turned out to the best part of the meal. The wife ordered a glass of Woodbridge Pinot Noir that she said tasted like it had been open for a month.  We started off with an order of edamame (which looked and tasted like it was frozen, and then overcooked), and miso soup which was quite bland. For dinner we ordered the Red Dragon roll, the Three Rivers roll and the Polamalu roll. All three rolls were not impressive at all.  We left having the same bloated feeling that you get when eating cheap MSG-loaded Chinese food. The server took another long while to pick up our check when we were finished. We won't be coming here again."
"1","Don't believe the hype. I have been here several times and have been treated with some scorn. Don't judge me because I'm dressed sloppily with no makeup, I get my nails done on my day off. The place is crammed with soccer moms with babies in tow all getting their rock star gels and sipping Starbucks. I'm pretty much the misfit. Guess I don't deserve the same attention. Helpful hint, Pink: don't judge.  I can afford to go anywhere I want, even if I don't look like that to you. Anyway, they charge extra for almond-shape and stilettos because \""we have to shape them.\"" What??? You don't need to shape square or ovals?? After three days, my tips started falling off one by one, and they charged me $3.00 to fix each one and blamed me. No way. I have never, ever had an acrylic set this bad. With so many choices in the area, why would anyone settle for rudeness and shoddy overpriced work?"
"2","'Twas the week before Christmas and all through the QC, Yelpers were celebrating - more American Mules for you and for me!\n\nThank you IOS for hosting such an awesome Yelp holiday party! Nikki W has done it again! Thank you to Poprock for catching really fun moments, your pictures always depict the fun environment perfectly! (#alloftheexclamationmarks)\n\nThis was such a fun event!  I completely fell in love with the American Mule cocktail, and the punch was delicious too. The food line was long, but worth it. Everything was made just right, and the lamb was so tasty. Perfect little selection of hummus, meat and extras. I didn't know that IOS existed Uptown, but I'll be sure to add it to my list of Uptown food options.  I loved getting to chat with Yelpers that I hadn't met before and catch up with the regulars.  \n\nAnd cheers to the Smores bar!! (Thank you again to Poprock for not catching me shoving the whole marshmallow in my mouth...)\n\nHappy Holidays all!!  Lookout, 2015!"
"2","Just wanted to say Thank You to everyone at Arizona Cold AIr for taking good care of my family.  Wayne and Mark are honest, fair guys and the a/c installer Jose was professional, friendly, and showed up exactly when he said he would.  The new a/c is great and we couldn't be more grateful  to AZ Cold Air and their wonderful employees.  Look no further for your A/C needs as they are the best."
"1","This place sucks.  It's small, and their advertisements all over TV are BS.  They don't have any regular keno machines.  Payouts on the machine games are crap.  Only thing they have going for them is the location.  I was super excited to be able to hit a casino 30 minutes from Glendale instead of having to go out to Casino Arizona or Fort McDowell.  \n\nWon't make that mistake again."
"2","After going to see Eat, Pray, Love, of course there was nothing I was craving more than authentic Italian food!!! I've been here before for lunch and dinner, so Pestos was the first place that popped into my head. This place apparently has been around for YEARS and I'm not surprised-their food is amazing! I ended up getting take-out rather than braving the bar solo (there's also a separate dining area) and ordered the linguini with white clam sauce (it was to die for!), mozzarella sticks with marinara, olives (not a huge fan of the sesame bread that comes with it), and OF COURSE a cannoli for dessert! The linguini was perfectly done and the clam sauce was amazing with just the right amount of clams. The mozzarella sticks were so-so, nothing special about them that I was thinking I should have gotten the stuffed mushrooms instead...these I KNOW are worth it...oh well, next time. The olives (an appetizer) were a delightful blend of 4 or so different types and it definitely hit the spot-I love olives!! They come with sesame bread, which I'm not really a fan of but I was craving carbs so I smothered some butter on it and was over it pretty fast. Now, I have NEVER had a cannoli as delicious as the ones I've gotten from Pesto's! Ever. These are absolutely melt-in-your-mouth amazing! From the chocolate chips inside to the crushed pistaccios outside sprinkled with a little powdered sugar and a fresh, crispy shell, your mouth will thank you!! Everyone that works here is absolutely amazing! It's a family business and their pride of ownership shows in everything they do. I've NEVER had bad service here and even when they're over-run with the high schoolers (note to self: don't go during Seton's lunch hour), their service has always been top-notch! I highly recommend checking them out-even if it is just for an amazing cannoli! =)"
"2","I decided to watch to show when it came out as it was said to be, \""The Sensual side of Cirque\"" and it did live up to motto. I knew I was going to run into some sexual, raunchy and of course half naked bodies running around on stage and doing some erotic acrobatic moves but I'll leave that to your imagination. \n\nMMMmm....\n\nIt was recommended that we book on the 2nd level of the theater because we'd have a better view then the front rows, plus it was less expensive so why not? The intro was unlike no other Cirque show I've seen. The host was a tall slender drag queen that would talk to the audience and ask intimidating questions about who are they with and some sexual questions that were provocative and humorous. All the dancers were talented and I enjoyed all the acts, throughout the show I've seen all types of body types on stage, full figure woman half naked, tall and small people and very attractive men and woman. I think it was suppose to evoke a sense of erotica sexual energy and being comfortable with the human body. I enjoyed every second of this show and still have some of the acts in my memory. \n\nThis truly was a sensual experience!"
"1","Very marginal food, service, and atmosphere.  there is a live bill out front, and it really makes the whole area smell like cow flops. Disneyland atmosphere."
"2","This was my favorite place when I lived in Vegas. Good beef dishes. A consistent kitchen preparing time-honored recipes. Sabado Gigante on the TV renders it somehow m\u00e1s aut\u00e9ntico."
"2","This is a really nice Macy's to shop at... it somehow feels 'higher' end because it is not organized like the other mall Macy's and because their dressing rooms are spacious, well-lit, and modernly decorated... whereas the mall rooms are like going to try clothes on at Ross!\n\nI found a decent selection of maternity clothes in their itty bitty section of Maternity, so I was satisfied.  The prices were Macy's prices, but they had a coupon you could use for 10% off (unless it was the Motherhood brand... yay for me!.. not!)...  so I didn't get to use it for this purchase.\n\nBesides the very nice decor and layout and modern feel of the Macy's, here were a few things I noted:  The ladies working here were genuinely NICE ladies... very friendly, helpful, talkative, just had a great attitude.  I would come back here over the Chandler Mall just for that :)\n\nPS: they have a Starbucks here but couldn't accept by Gold Card because their system wasn't linked?? :( no Americano for momma."
"2","Nobou presents itself as Japanese tapas. The flavors were quite amazing - the portions, even for tapas, were quite small however. We ordered 6 plates and 2 beers and walked out with a $120 bill. It was quite a treat but the price was somewhat of a turn off."
"1","Reviewers said order pretzels and hotdogs. Ordered them excitedlywaited. Then twenty minutes later was told they were out of both. On a Sunday at 6. With six people in the place. Worst service ever.....shift change and was forgotten in the process. Had to go to bar and ask for drinks then for the check. Turkey sausage was cold and on a cold bun. Very disappointed.....never again!"
"1","If there's any way you can make it over to Total Wine in Arrowhead, then without a doubt: pass this place up!  \n\nThough we haven't always found what we came looking for, they admittedly do have a decent selection. \n\nThe handful of times that we've been in, it has been due to convenience.  However, the poor customer service always leaves me grimacing as we walk out the door.  Even when we came with a friend who was buying several bottles of Dom Perignon for his own wedding, spending hundreds and hundreds of dollars there, the service he received was horrendous.  We were all appalled.\n\nThere are definitely better places to find what you are looking for!"
"1","Love the Tupelo in Ashville, go every chance we get! Hadnt tried the Charlotte location util recently. We took my mother to celebrate her 62 birthday on a Sunday night. Service was friendly and prompt if a little underwhelming. Portions were nice, selection and food were good. Overall the experience would have been positive if A) the bass from the nightclub downstairs hadnt been thumping through the floor the whole dinner and B) if someone (likely from the club downstairs) hadn't keyed the word \""FUC&ER\"" into the side of my mothers car. Its not Tupelos fault but as an honest review, you have to park to enjoy a meal. May be safest to stick to brunches here before the club goers wake up."
"2","The Sweet n' Spicy Burger is the best burger I have ever had in my life.  It's not so much the actual burger patty that is delicious, but the combination of toppings that make it so unbelievable.  The fried ratatouille gives it a little crunch.  The candied jalepenos provide just enough sweet to balance out the spice factor.  As you're chewing it just kind of melts together in your mouth.  I could eat one every day for the rest of my life.  Simply amazing.\n\nThe Mac n' Cheese with ham is stellar.  Super creamy and smooth.  Probably not low in calories.  The fries are crispy and seasoned just right.  And don't forget the mini doughnuts!  They're the perfect sweet after your meal and the salty caramel dipping sauce is pretty much orgasmic.  If there's any left over, you'll be eating it with a spoon.\n\nHighly recommend.  Great neighborhood gem."
"1","I visit Phoenix frequently and this is my first stay at this location. The hotel is marginal, but needs some major updates. The breakfast is less than mediocre and seems like they are always low on supply. The last 2 mornings I arrived to find nothing but crumbs left for eggs. Lastly,  the customer service rep (I wont mention any names) who checked me in needed additional training on how to treat loyal customers. She was very rude and short during check in which I find uncommon for the brand."
"1","Food was good. Price ok. The hostess sent us to the 2nd floor. Don't go to the 2nd floor.\nFor the owner to have the servers go up and down those steep stairs like that is despicable. Even a great waiter would have problem providing good service under these conditions. The serving staff is composed of students. Hence the simplest of request for a breakfast place becomes a chore."
"2","I enjoy this place. My friend brought me one of their business cards and we were both oohing and ahhing over the design (we're nerds.) At my first opportunity, I drove downtown and ordered one of their signature drinks. It was delicious and the staff are very friendly and welcoming. Drink in hand, I sat outside and caught up on some reading. There's plenty of downtown flavor in this neighborhood, think you'll enjoy it."
"1","Oh, I wanted to love this place! I really did. Phoenix NEEDS cupcakes, desserts, pastries, etc! I was very underwhelmed. \n\nThe Key Lime cupcake was the best of the lot. I'm a sucker for key lime, but that's this cupcake's saving grace. The flavor was very subtle, and this is a trend with all the cupcakes. \n\nThe Lemon cupcake was very much lacking in flavor. Even more subtle than the Key Lime. \n\nOne good thing are the cakes themselves; at least they're moist. And the ratio of frosting to cake is spot on. However the flavors are not quite what I was expected, especially given how much each cupcake cost. \n\nI'll probably try this place again sometime next year, if they're still in business. Maybe there will be a tastier batch of cupcakes! As for now I'm going to pass. \n\nOn a side note, the ladies behind the counter were in fact very kind and personable."
"2","Etti is great!\nShe took our family pics and also our son's first birthday pictures. \nShe was nice, professional and easy to work with. Her prices were affordable, too.\nHighly recommended!"
"1","I just want to get rid of my Acne scars, but he prescribed me with a very strong medicine with very strong side effects even he knows I can't take it. I felt really sick. Then he gave me another facial gel, I just used it twice and got serious allergy for days with affects my work too. Then he prescribed me with another liquid which contains alcohol to cure the allergy, which make my face even burned more!!!!!!!!!!!! I have to use iced milk to cure myself now. If you are pretty and don't want to become ugly, then never go to Charles Brown's office!!"
"1","Just alright.  Had this baked potato with some of their BBQ brisket on top.  It was OK."
"1","Impressed with a cheery hello as soon as we walked in.\n \nThen, noticed the booth table needed scrubbing, it was sticky. Ketchup bottle very very dirty, floor dirty, windows dirty. It was a dirty place.\n\nFood good, pancakes nothing special as the name might imply. We might give it another try to see if they have learned restaurant basics, like providing a clean restaurant for customers.\n\nPlace needs help."
"1","Was with a group of business colleagues for a pre-set meal. The service was excellent, but the food left a lot to be desired. Chicken Piccata was flavorless and served on a bed of pasta that was even more bland. Others shrugged off their food (steak and Cannelloni)with a \""Meh, not so good.\"" I had expected much better.  Chocolate raspberry cake was yummy."
"1","We were excited to try this restaurant.  We had been long time patrons of when it was the \""Dirty Drummer\"" and the \""51 Cafe\"".  We went about a month ago and it was so crowded that we had to leave.  Tonight we went and there were not many people and were seated right away.  The waitress came immediately and was very pleasant and efficient.  I ordered the pulled pork with a side of their potato salad.  My husband ordered the turkey melt.  My pork was just ok, I have had much better. The cole slaw that came with it was excellent.  His sandwich was good.  He wanted some mustard and had to go to the bar to get it as the waitress had disappeared.  The biggest issue I had was the side of potato salad I ordered.  Although they said it was homemade, it tasted like what you buy at the grocery store.  Not good at all.  I took one bite of it and told the waitress that  I didnt' like it and that it did not taste homemade.  She assured me that it was, and that she would let the chef know.  However, even though I only had a bite, the 4.00 charge was still on our check.  Very poor.  In addition, my husband had a scotch on the rocks with a splash of water.  $10 for the scotch and $2 for the rocks?    Who charges $2 for ice?  So all in all, with tip, over $50 for a mediocre dinner. What a shame!  We won't be back.  It's hard to believe that this place gets the reviews I'm seeing."
"1","I  have been to this establishment before and i was obsessed. The pizza was solid,  and I was super amped to eat here again tonight. OMG, can you say  totally grossed out by this place. The chick who was cooking did not have a hair net on, and she was freely shaking her hair over the food. WTF! Are hair nets or even hats for line workers  a thing of the past? No gloves either.... And to top it off, she took her bare hands and touched her hair......right in front of the customers and continued doing her thing. What the hell? I am never eating here again...yuck"
"2","I love to find a locally own restaurant. Nothing beats it! The owners of this delightful cafe are friendly and kind, as well as great cooks! The food is amazing. I have loved everything I've had there, from the quiche to the soup to the delicious lemonades, and for a treat, the scones.\n\nHighly recommended!"
"1","Sad attempt at a breakfast.. They got off to a good start with nicely baked muffins, but blew it up with re-heated potatoes, and microwaved eggs.. \nI do not recommend, unless you plan to have lots of cocktails before your food arrives."
"2","Great place for BBQ in Anthem. When you get a chance try their creation called the Hog Dog, don't be scared it's not as spicy as the description may imply. The Ribs are better than average, the fried macaroni and cheese lacks flavor. As for everything else on the menu, it's great. I can say that because I have tasted the whole menu already."
"1","I did not like eating here! Food was below-average quality. Sushi had no flavor - the only thing you can taste is the mayo sauce they squeeze all over ALL of the rolls. The Mongolian BBQ has no flavor (there's no sauces for you to choose like at a real MBBQ joint), lots of fried food (cheap), what fresh fish they did have (shrimp) I just didn't trust. Service makes you feel like you're an imposition. Signs all over the walls about the ramifications if you waste food. Jeeze. Never going here again. A friend talked me into going... next time I PICK THE RESTAURANT."
"2","I'm a big scotch fan, and if you are too, then this is the place for you. Great selection of single malts as well as blends if that's your taste preference (mine). Had appetizers and Scottish ale beer on my recent visit, and sat at the bar. The menu looked interesting and I'll be back to try more of it."
"2","One of my all time favorite burger joints! They do one thing, and they do it well! A very simple menu of just burgers, fries, shakes, & soda......period!\n\nI remember the very first time I ever walked into an In-N-Out............ordered me a hamburger, ate it............then thought..........\""is that it?\"" I was wondering what's the big deal? \nIt wasn't until one of my friends, who is an In-N-Out fanatic told me - \""NO\""..........anytime you go to an In-N-Out, you must always order the Double Double!!!\n\nSince that time...............whenever I'm on the mainland, and walk into a In-N-Out burger joint, I always order a Double Double! \n\nWhat can I say about the In-N-Out burger joint............\n\n1. I wished they would open one up in Hawaii.\n\n2. Food is cheap, only $3.20 for a Double Double, & very tasty too! Burgers are made to order on the spot, hot & fresh..........not like some other joints where they are microwaved & put under the heat lamp. \n\n3. A very simple menu. They just do burgers, fries, shakes, & soda..........keepin' it simple, & they do it well!\n\n4. Restaurant is very clean, and the service is EXCELLENT!\n\n5. Open fountain kept very clean...........McDonald's could learn a thing or to (hint: McCully McDonalds!).\n\nLots of free parking..........but the place is always crowded on matter what time you go there.........Ka CHING!\n\nI also heard from a friend to order the Double Double \""Animal Style\""...........don't know what this is...........I'll have to try it one day."
"1","Since we had a coupon ($25 for $50 of food) that was set to expire, my husband & I dined here for a belated birthday dinner.  Unfortunately, it didn't live up to our expectations.\n\nService was very slow.  It took over 5 minutes to be greeted by the assistant waiter, than 10 more for our head waiter to take our drunk order.  I had the lemon drop which was pretty good.  The wine recommended to my husband was enjoyable.\n\nI had the onion soup to start and it was nothing special.  I ate maybe a fourth of it.  I ordered the petite filet and my husband the bone-in ribeye.  I chose the mashed potatoes and he chose the lobster mac-n-cheese.  (I don't eat seafood.)  It took a very long time to get our food. The steaks were nothing special.  My mashed potatoes are better.  These were bland.  We skipped dessert and won't be back."
"2","Love the specials. The Cuban is the best."
"1","Really nice lady, too bad she burned me with the wax and cut me with her tweezers, my private area is a mess right now and actually burns. BTW I've been waxing myself for 3 years so I am experienced. I did it cause sometimes I get lazy, what a wasted Groupon and now I have to wait to heal, so much pain."
"2","I had to much fun going! I'm not much of a zoo person and prefer conservation centers more because I feel like the enclosures at most zoos are too small for the animals. This place had very wide open and big enclosures for most of the animals and I really enjoyed that. I would come back again!  They have an almost pure white tiger and a white lion, those are both pretty rare cats and it was worth admission just to see these beautiful cats. Most, if not all of the animals were out to see. \nThe only few complaints I would have about this place is the soda machines are almost all out of order, there isn't a whole lot of signs around to tell you where certain exhibits are. The jaguar seemed agitated and I felt horrible for him and couldn't find any water for him anywhere and he was warm and panting. Also some of the rides were down that should've been working. \nAll in all I would come back here again, but maybe in the winter when the weather cools down. Be ready to do some walking if you go to this zoo because its huge and there's a lot to see. The aquariums were beautiful and so were the fish."
"1","This place was just horrible. Why would you make customers wait 10-15 min before telling them that you dont have what they ordered? Service was bad, the food that we did receive was mediocre at best. They offered a wide selection of food but about half of their menu was out of stock. Seriously, how do you not have eggrolls?"
"2","I've been to La Fitness, Pure Fitness, and Bally's. I prefer 24 Hour Fitness to all of those. For one, it doesn't stink like sweaty balls when you walk in, this location is open 24 hours even on the weekends, and I hardly ever have to wait for my favorite machines. They keep the place fairly clean  although some of the machines (especially the ab blaster) could use some TLC. It's fun to people watch and there are some really sexy men that work out there, even more of an incentive."
"2","This was a pleasant surprise for airport food, yes its pricey but at least its worth it.  They have killer french press coffee, they bring you a big carafe for 2 that makes at least 5-6 cups.  I ordered the chilaquiles which were tasty and my husband had the Mexican omelet.  The service was really good too, since we were in a time crunch they served us pretty quick.  If in the area again I would definitely come back and try the cochinita pibil witch is supposed to be the house specialty."
"2","Gourmet Pizza that doesn't disappoint.  I was sure pleasantly surprised.  I thought I'd take my kids there to pick up some pizza.  Super-friendly staff, clean, and very speedy service.  I had the \""My Greek\"" Pizza with the artichoke hearts, lite sauce, kalamata olives, onions and more, and kids had traditional Pepperoni.  We also got garlic knots that were the best I've had, loved them.  Highly recommend that you try this, there are so many selections, if you go to pizzayourway.com you can see their menu.  Will definitely be going there again.  They have wine too!"
"2","I have dined here on several occasions for lunch and dinner and I have walked away happy every time. This isn't the place to go if your looking for creative or innovative fine dining. The best words I could use to describe the food is upscale bar food. Flat breads, Burgers, Salads, Rotisserie Chickens they have it all. Everything is reasonably priced and you can get in and out pretty quickly without spending a fortune."
"2","Finally got around to visiting this place and it was better than expected. Saturday night and the place was full - for good reason. Nice fresh blue point oysters on the half shell, steamed clams ( steamed in broth which was almost better than the clams!). Fish ceviche - tasty, fresh - actually got one to go. Tamale del Mar with pablanos - didn't overwhelm the seafood. All the sides - slaw, beans, rice weren't swimming in whatever sauce which made them stand out for their own taste. Definitely will revisit - have to try the tacos next time! Don't know why we didn't but all the other items looked great and were great."
"2","Great german beer made in Wisconsin sold here!!!! you must try it"
"2","WHERE: Paradise between Sands & Flamingo.\n\nWHEN: They open at 5pm and close at 4am I believe. My friend and I attempted to go there around lunchtime, and should have researched beforehand... lol\n\nWHY: If you are a Teppanyaki first timer like I was, it is definitely a must! Muahaha!\n\nWHAT: My friend and I randomly decided to redeem ourselves and try out Musashi when they were actually open, so we headed here at 6pm! We made reservations just incase (better to be safe than sorry), and it wasn't as busy as I thought it would be. Hallelujah! The decor was quite nice and intimate, we were seated, and ordered.\n\nThe staff were all so sweet! From our server to our Chef (we had Chef Octavio) - phenomenal! =D\n\nWe were first asked the occasion of us being there, we replied \""For Fun.\"" I did not think my \""for fun\"" answer would lead to such surprising consequence, but it really was FUN! I don't want to ruin it for you first-timers, so just get on in there and have fun! Lol. THERE IS DEFINITELY A SURPRISE WAITING FOR YOU... MUAHAHA!\n\nOn the food-end of the spectrum, it was delicious! My friend and I decided to get the filet mignon/shrimp/lobster combo. It was accompanied with several sauces (I am a saucy type of girl. Lol), veggies to start with, and tasty fried rice to pair with the seafood and meat. While Chef Octavio was cooking our food in front of us, I was like a child embracing every cool moment1 Who would have ever known cooking could be such entertainment!!\n\nOverall, this experience definitely goes in the books!! From the workers, people, and food... FIYAHHHHH!!!"
"2","We have been going to Caring Hands with our dogs and cats for many years.  Dr. Curt saw us through the aging and passing of two cats and a dog, all well into old age with great quality of life.  \n\nDr. Curt also saw us through the adoption of a new dog, who has a specialized problem: an urge to eat every inedible object and substance he encounters.  At 7 months old, our new puppy developed a serious bowel obstruction and required removal of 3 feet of his intestines and reattachment.  This was a complicated and risky surgery.  Because of Curt's supreme surgical skill, that dog is with us today at 4 years old, happy and loved.\n\nDr. Rebecca is also an outstanding vet, both in terms of skill and caring feeling for animals and their human families.  We have now seen Dr. Rebecca many times for the regular care of the \""dog who lived\"" and the newest addition to our family, another rescue dog (who came to us with a number of minor healthcare problems).  We trust Dr. Rebecca implicitly.\n\nThe staff at Caring Hands are also amazing -- good with people, competent at the animal health care business, loving to animals and able to calm and handle them.  The staff has low turnover, and some of them, like Gigi, have been there as long as we have.  \n\nYou could not choose a better vet service in the Champaign-Urbana and surrounding areas.  If you are at some distance in an outlying small town (as we are), they are well worth the drive."
"1","The best part of this meal was the frozen hot chocolate (which was comp'd by Caesars).  The food was so so at best.  My sliders were burnt, which I send back and did not want a replacement since I don't have some 3 second rule to happen with the replacement.  The tomato soup was delicious, but probably all canned."
"2","Love the concept and long over due in P-Town!\n\nThis one should be broken out:\n5 star - the idea\n5 star - the beer\n2 star - the fancy food\n4 star - the burgers and the like\n\nBUT I bet they start doing their seafood and such better.  I'm always so excited about a lobster roll, but meh, I'd not order the ANA one again.\n\nSo get a burger, and a beer!"
"2","Thai Basil was a good addition to Park Central. this neglected mall is a ghost town at night. I'm sure Thai Basil can do  good business off the assorted Club Central crowd, as either a before or post happy hour eatery. Open till 9pm on Saturday is good for me too. \n\nthe Menu is typical Thai fare. the spring rolls i really enjoyed. they have yellow corn stuffed in side. i was quite surprised by it. I'm used to cabbage, clear rice noodles and various carrots, but CORN!! it was freaking delish. the dipping sauce was accompanied by a small salad.\n\ni ordered Red Currey (Medium Spice) it was very flavorful..but..medium?. i didn't notice any heat. not like in a mild. but like a missing heat. next time I'm going hot. and i pray they deliver the goods. i want scorching. tongue tingling action here.\n\nmy homegirl got Garlic Vegetable with chicken, (Mild) we both figured go weak on this one cause she's not a hot person. and if it was weak. toss on some chili sauce. so..yea chili sauce was added.  the flavors were on point. garlicky and full of taste. not often do you see green beans in Asian food. i think the playful touches add allot. \n\nlike David S.B. noticed in his review. Thai Elephant was much hotter. if these two restaurants are indeed related. i wonder why the flavor variations?? \nthe decor is also quite different. there was only one image on the wall. and it looked like a WW2 Era picture of a family member who was serving in the Thai Liberation army or something. (i just made that up)\nwhich is a juxtaposition of most Thai restaurants i have been to which have random Buddhist idols and what-nots. honestly i like the change up.\n\ntotal on the bill for two entrees and an order of spring rolls was 36.Change which is pretty good.\n\nif Thai Basil and Thai Elephant are related. i think they have little twists that make each place different. i look forward to returning.\n\n\nthere was a party of about 8-9 when we arrived, which at the time we got there. they were the only other people in the restaurant. so i think this place is good for groups...as of now. when this place picks up in popularity..i don't think it would be all that comfortable with a large group..inside. outside will be great. lots of ceiling fans to keep the area cool."
"1","I've definitely experienced better. But it's a decent price. So you gotta weigh the possibilities here.\n\nThe wait was quick. With a club card, it's $14.95 for dinner, which isn't too shabby. Bottles of wine can be purchased for $7.\n\nThe buffet is on the smaller side and offers seafood, Mexican, Asian, Italian, BBQ, salad, and dessert options. The seafood and BBQ sections are where to fill up. They doubt the prime rib and shrimp - and both were the highlights of my dining experience here. I also enjoyed the potato salad and pasta salad.\n\nGo in hungry, with low expectations, and not craving anything in particular."
"2","Excellent food, and great service from Matt. We had to wait a moment, less than 5 minutes, before being seated for lunch at approximately 11:30. The lobster flatbread was well-cooked and balanced in flavors, and my guest's duck looked quite good. The wine selection is excellent."
"2","I love Lush products and its located in our Hotel... well sign me up!!! \n\nHad amazing service on December 28th by a young lady I can not recall her name but what a great gal! She was super helpful and got me to spend more than I wanted too!! :) Not that its hard at Lush.. \n\nnow my bathroom smells yummy at home and so did my hotel room! :)\n\nCan't wait for Fashion Island's to open!"
"1","The line was long to get in for a Friday (2/20).  The employees openly talked about their frustrations to one another while checking us in.  TACKY!  Save it for the break room ladies.  I don't need to hear about how your Manager made you come out and help.. ME! \n\nWhat can I say?  It was a basic room.  Queen bed my eye though.  We were like sardines in there.  But what do you expect in Vegas.  The 2 rooms were about $320 for 2 nights.  The bathrooms don't have fans.  A bit odd.  We had to open the doors while showering to let the steam out.  The only cool thing was the iron and ironing board in the room.  The were doing construction on the pool area when we went.  Might want to check that out before booking your stay.  And they are dead serious on cut off being 4 p.m. for the pool.  You can't even get in there to see what it looks like cause they lock the doors.  Oh, and it's $30 for late check-out.  No courtesty hour here!"
"2","Very good food, fair prices and portions.  Will definitely be back.  On the down side, they never provide enough rice on to-go orders."
"1","First of all, there's hardly any information online on hours and rental prices so after getting lost for a little bit trying to find the place we ended up getting there at 2:45. We get there only to find out that they only take cash (information that is not available on the website) and that we would have to drive 7 miles down the road to the nearest ATM and be back by the time they close rentals at 3:30 (also not on the website). We did that and got back at 3:15 only to find that they decided to close early for the day after specifically telling us that they would be open until 3:30. \n\nWe essentially wasted 3 hours of our time and a lot of money in gas and all we got were coupons for $10 rentals in the future. WE DIDN'T EVEN GET TO GO DOWN THE RIVER. Waste of time, waste of a day, horrible customer service. I would rate 0/5 if I could, but because they are the only game in town I suppose I have no choice to go back \n\nSide note: $17 for a tube rental is a ridiculous price for a piece of rubber and a 5 minute bus ride."
"2","I have given Berge all of my service business since 2007.  I will echo the other reviews re:  Vince Medina--he is the best.  Mike in Service is a great fellow as well.  The techs are top-notch and work fast.  I have never been \""gouged\"" in terms of price or an attempted, unnecessary \""upsell\"" as I have at other dealerships in the past.  They have a customer for life.  If the time ever comes for me to buy another Mazda, they'll have that business as well.  THANK YOU for such great service!"
"2","I love this place! Great teriyaki and only ranking 4 as my husbands burger wasn't up to par temp wise"
"2","DLUX has great burgers and even better fries. I've been here a number of times and I have never had a bad time or meal. The same goes for the drinks - their specialty cocktails are always mixed perfectly."
"1","First time in visiting here, the food was good but its not worth a second visit after the terrible and rude service we got."
"1","Wow....2 lunch items, 2 sodas + tip = $45!\nOuch... Service was good .... Pasta was ... Pasta...."
"2","What an awesome little hidden gem inside of a gas station. Yes, you totally wouldn't expect a joint such as this at a gas station to serve such good food like Chile Verde does, but you are in for a surprise. Plus, you can't really see their signage since it's on the same one as the gas station prices, but I guess they get all their business through word of mouth and of course Yelp. Our church group uses this gas station for our fireworks booth and 2 years ago when we first did it I didn't really pay much attention to them. Now that I read all these awesome reviews I definitely had to try them out. During our 6 days we were there I tried them 2 times and they certainly did not disappoint! The first time I had the nachos with beef and everyone is right the tortilla chips are made fresh and they are delicious. Unlike, Roberto's who has dry nachos and carne asada, their version of beef nachos was certainly not dry but had some moisture to them. I'm glad I asked for my beans on the side because it would of ruined the awesome texture of the fresh tortilla chips. The second time I ordered the California burrito, which was priced at around $5. This burrito was huge! At other places they would probably price it at $6 or $7 which makes Chile Verde affordable. I bet 2 people with smaller appetites could share that burrito because I could only eat 3/4 and let me tell you I am an eater. The inside of the burrito had fries and beef with salsa. Pretty delicious I must say. My only major gripe is that the owner is a 1 man show! He is the cashier, the cook, the expediter, everything! I know he is probably doing that to reduce costs and keep prices low, but man the wait time is rather long just like everyone says. Both times I was there, he was super busy. Although the second time the food came our faster than the first. The first time I think I waited a good 15 minutes. If only I lived in this area, but I guess this joint adds on to the foodie spots on Rainbow Blvd/South West area. The chimichanga looks good and I will order that next time I'm here. Chile Verde is definitely a step up above Roberto's and if you're in the area craving Mexican food, definitely hit Chile Verde up!"
"1","Keep on driving by.........\n\nI don't understand the high reviews.   I've been here twice just to check myself.\n\nBoth coffee and espresso have no taste.\n\nTo boot, wireless does not work well.  I had to use a neighboring business.\n\nMove on to the next place......."
"2","Just got my car tinted at Bill's 1 month ago.\n\nWent really well.  Excellent service and results.  Made an appointment on Sat and car was done on time as promised.  After the typical dry up period, did not see mistake anywhere."
"2","My second favorite vietnamese restaurant in the valley. Great pho, great atmosphere... spring rolls are to die for. Can't go wrong with this place, everything is good here!"
"1","This mall is sad. You will actually feel bad for this mall. Only a couple shops are open and they are either shoe stores, clothing or cell phones. The food court doesn't make any sense and not very inviting. Also there wasn't a mrs. Fields cuz I was craving cookies. Lol\n\nYour better off going to the flea market for better stuff and cheaper prices!"
"1","Went here on a Friday night with my fiance on 4/12 for drinks at around 5:30 PM and noticed upon entering that the pub was empty. We were seated by the hostess at a table where the sun blinded us, so we decided to move to a table right behind where we were placed. After about 10 minutes, we had still not been acknowledged by a server so I went back to the hostess and asked her if we could have someone take our orders. After another 5 minutes, our orders were finally taken. The food was decent but the service was absolute crap so I left her a dollar tip."
"1","When the fish tastes like ham there is something wrong.  I would compare this to a cheap $5 buffet that costs $20 per plate.  We are trying to get our money back right now, everything is bad.  Hope I don't get sick."
"2","I visited the first day as well as another time after. The store is well lit and the aisles are wide meaning they put into thought the hundreds of college students nearby. The selection was well stocked both times and the staff was helpful when I could not find something. There is also a parking garage and security. One star off because there are times you may need to head over to GE for hard-to-find items, but if you shop mostly at Aldi, you're already ahead of your budget and the quality is very similar. Don't forget your quarter to rent your cart as well as your heavy duty grocery bags :) I love the entire Aldi experience and the savings! :)"
"2","I saw a few reviews on this place and decided to check it out. I had no idea it was so close to us and right next to the Von's I frequent. Not sure how I overlooked this place.\n\nI'm originally from northern Illinois, about 90 miles outside of Chicago. My wife had never been to Illinois until a couple of years ago. While there we went to Taste of Chicago where she had her first Chicago dog and immediately fell in love.\n\nWe have been to Windy City twice in the past two weeks since discovering it. The second time we invited my parents who also were in search of a little taste of home.\n\nThe first time we went, my wife got the Chicago dogs and a Green River (limey ginger ale soda). I got the Italian sausage and a pizza puff. I'm not  a big fan of hot dogs, but my wife confirmed they were solid reproductions of authentic Chicago dogs. The Italian sausage was decent. I had never had a pizza puff before and am now a fan. My wife's meal came with fries which were really good, nice and thin and crispy. Just the way I like them.\n\nThe second time we went my wife again got a Chicago dog. I got an Italian beef sandwich. I don't think I'd ever had an Italian beef sandwich before. I got mine dipped with cheese, peppers, and giardinera. I liked mine a lot. I think I'll get that again. I might get it wet though, which ironically is drier than the dipped. The dipped was really good but the sogginess made it difficult to eat."
"1","I came in here with my service dog once and was publicly embarrassed when the manager came up to me and told me to wait outside. And no dogs were allowed. When I said he was a service dog and that he provides service for my PTSD she told me that law doesn't apply in Arizona. I didn't even know how to react. Under the American Disabilities Act (which is federal law) you are allowed to bring in a service dog to help with post traumatic stress disorder and employees are only allowed to ask if it is a service dog and what service it provides. My dog is trained, doesn't bark, doesn't pay attention to any people, and just sits by my side. I've never been kicked out of a restaurant or store before. They didn't even bring me my drink. I just sat outside and they left it inside where I was no longer able to go."
"2","So good!\nThe sugar shack special is to die for! So tasty! Also the lady next to me got the shrimp crepe...which looked like heaven on a plate. \n\nEnglish/French menu!\n\nWifi password is: suzette3"
"2","Amazing Japanese food.  Expensive, but worth it for the freshness, variety, atmosphere and service,  Make sure to book well in advance."
"1","Well, based on the reviews, I would have to say that the sushi was disappointing. The flavor and quality of the sushi was decent, but the portions of the fish on the rolls was very skimpy. I have eaten a lot of sushi in my life and this was by far the smallest servings of fish that I have ever seen. Even my out of town guests commented.\n\nThe customer service was pretty good, that's about the best I can say, unfortunately."
"2","First of all, can Yelp afford to give 1/2 stars?  The better question is, why CAN'T Yelp(!) afford 1/2 stars?  I might have given the extra 1/2 star, but for no reason at all, Yelp won't allow me that option.  I cannot believe that.  Of course Yelp must think this page is perfect and cannot be interrupted.  I disagree.\n\nI finally made it to Indulge and let me just say, I indulged.  Whoa.  The visuvio burger was great.  Moist, a damned good burger.  {Note to self: a few criticisms: \n1)wheat bun wasn't good.  It's tough and not tasty.  Ok, next time I'll try another kind of bun but the wheat bun wasn't \""my bad choice\"", it was just bad.\n2) if I order mushrooms on the burger, who said I wanted mushrooms on the side?  Mustard, ketchup, mayo...same thing.  Ordered it, wanted it, PUT IN ON THE DAMNED BURGER!!!   I want it ON THE BURGER!   But that's just me.  I could be wrong.}\n\nWhat DID impress me the most here wasn't even the burger I was eating.  It was what the guy next to me was eating.  Seriously.  Here I was, eating a really immense burger, juicy, delicious but what kept catching my eye was the Salmon Salad the guy was eating next to me.  And it didn't help that he was savoring EVERY SINGLE BITE..\n\nAnd a joint that's friendly, clean (very), can do a fabulous gigumbo burger...AND a delicious looking Salmon Salad, that's a good joint.\n\nI say thumbs up~!!!!"
"1","3125 reviews, 4328 photos, & a 4-star rating of the Wicked Spoon buffet at the Cosmopolitan of Vegas. I loved what I read & the pics that I saw of the many upscale-type offerings + their unique presentations.  I was looking forward to trying this AYCE, as my expectations were based on high standards from similar previous buffet experiences at Bellagio, Wynn, & Paris.\n \nHowever, I was so disappointed in my dining experience at WS for the following reasons:\n\n- Changes in the buffet offerings.   Many of the buffet offerings were not reflective of early Yelp reviews/photos posted since it opened in Dec. 2010. Foods were at one time presented in unique eye-catching servers in small portions so that you could try as much as possible, i.e., samples in mini pots, serving spoons, & bowls. While there were a few creative servings, e.g., noodles in Chinese take-out containers, fried chicken in mini fryer baskets, & boiled peanuts in paper cones, most of the food items are in large serving trays; just grab a serving spoon& serve yourself, just as in any buffet. Perhaps it proved to be too labor-intensive to offer so many individualized portions. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wicked-spoon-las-vegas?select=VkwXpPWxl7tN4yK8ETxjLA http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wicked-spoon-las-vegas?select=J9VUSLI3495TZ2MFxhpgvA \n\n- Many of the foods were not palatable. For example, the Chinese roast pork had crispy skins, but they were so tough that they were inedible; the snow crab legs were served cold, & they were the tiniest crab legs that I have ever seen w/ more shell than meat. Food items were simply overcooked, dried out from standing under a warmer for a length of time, & just plain tasteless. (Must give WS credit though, for offering upscale items, e.g., bone marrow, blackened fish, mac & cheese bar, kale salad; but they also had many items similarly offered at other buffets, e.g., pizzas, breads, teri chicken, beef ribs, potatoes, etc.) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wicked-spoon-las-vegas?select=-D60mxtVvUjwZ68IBp0YhQ \n\n- No lines to get into the buffet.  The top buffets in Vegas always have long lines that zigzag like you're waiting for a ride in Disneyland.  We walked right in for dinner at 6pm on a Tuesday evening w/ no lines whatsoever.  The dining room was not crowded. There apparently wasn't a demand for this buffet.\n\n- Buy one get one free offer was not available. Prior to leaving for Vegas, the local newspaper had an article re United Airlines offering a BOGO coupon for the WS on its Vegas flights; Yelp reviews also made mention of it. As I was flying on UAL, I asked the flight attendant on the Vegas leg re the coupon, & she/other attendants didn't know anything about it; never got the coupon. While we were at WS, I asked the manager, who said that the coupons were given out on only certain flights, such as those coming from Newark, NJ, but he was uncertain as to which flights. Although we had our UAL boarding passes, he said he could not honor those & could only honor the coupons if we had them. Then he told me to bring this to the attention of UAL, as they should clarify as to which flights had the coupons, while thanking me for bringing this to his attention so that he could alert his marketing people. \n\nYou would think that giving one BOGO coupon as a goodwill gesture would hardly make a dent in its profits. No deal.  Plus, wonder why they're even giving BOGO coupons - is it because there's no longer the demand of people flocking to it?\n\n- The price is high considering what you get. We paid $38/person for dinner on a weekday night ($47 on weekends). While the service is adequate, the quality of the food items does not justify this price. \n\nThe saving grace for this buffet is its dessert station.  They had a wonderful gelato/sorbet bar (loved the Thai iced tea & salted peanut caramel flavors) & heavenly huge chocolate-covered strawberries garnished w/ oreo cookie bits or Heath crunch bits. The extensive dessert station included chocolate molten lava cakes, pretty decorated cakes, raspberry/chocolate coffee rice krispy treats, red velvet cookies, parfaits, apple strudel, panna cotta, white chocolate mousse cones, macarons, etc.  Most of the desserts were excellent, but I would not pay $38 just to eat their desserts. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wicked-spoon-las-vegas?select=6PSAjVXFwaLgYS3mN4I30Q  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wicked-spoon-las-vegas?select=m4V11SUeP5XB1V3q9j_WNg \n \nAt least I can say I've dined here. Would I come here again? No."
"2","Welcome to your classic Scottsdale dive bar. Upon entry, bar to the right, tables to your left. Towards the back you'll find arcade games, darts, TVs and a pool table too. The biggest selling point is the patio in the back that features several places to sit and opens up into the huge alley which doubles as a parking lot; triples as a restroom for some patrons. \n\nDrinks are cheap and the bartenders are always in good spirits. You'll meet some interesting folk here on any given night, so don't be afraid to crack open some conversation along with your beer. I can't think of a dive bar that I've frequented more in Scottsdale than Roadrunner."
"1","I get all my prescriptions here,  only because its close to my house and also on my way to work, iIt is pretty nasty and worn down in there!!! It's dirty and old, hinky people walking all over the place.  I always feel I have to watch my back in there.  The customer service is nill.  They dont have any type of selection.  But, the pharmacy is ok, my meds are always done and ready on time.  Other then that this place is just weird.  Needs a major make over."
"1","If you want good Mexican food do not go here. It's the Mexican version of mcdonalds and I will never have it again."
"2","Service was perfect! And the food was more better. I shall return for more Pho and spring rolls. So delicious.\n\n-Above was my first review. This is my second. I love this very friendly and homey place. The food is delicious. I will return again again when I have a taste for Pho. Yum!"
"2","Great place to get beer while on the strip for cheap!"
"2","Terrific. The pizza is close enough to when I lived in Philly, and the flavored crust is great. The chicken is great, I tried the hot."
"1","Since nothing at ASU is really free anymore, at least having a free bus system (which won't be free anymore) is nice to take advantage of. Especially in the summer.  unfortunately the orbit, formally known as the neighborhood flash, doesn't quite make the free part worth it.  Sure  its nice that it goes to the little areas that you would usually have to walk to, but since it's free anyone can get on.  If you get a good bus driver he'll probably go the speed limit and stop at the actual orbit stop. Some bus drivers open the doors before they stop as if saying 'tuck and roll'.  I am not trying to get rid of the free service so soon, but if paying a little bit for better service and safety is what it takes...so be it! At least it could fund drivers that won't be texting and smashing the orbit busses into our brand new light rail system."
"1","I bought a groupon for my auto detail.   The website states that the detail includes (I have copied and pasted from their website): \nExterior Wash\nExterior/Interior Window Cleaning\nApply protective wax\nInterior vacuum\nWipe dash/console/cup holder areas\nShampoo Carpet\nShampoo/Clean Seats\nTires & Wheels Shined\n\nMy seats were NOT cleaned/shampooed.  Cupholders were NOT wiped clean.  Doorjambs were NOT cleaned.  I wanted my van detailed specifically to clean the seats and doorjambs.  I'm very disappointed in this service and strongly advise everyone to stay away from this company."
"2","My wife and originally visited Spamassage For You from a Amazon Local deal back in September.  We both enjoyed the  quality of the massages and friendly service of the staff and owners.  So much so that we bought a 3 massage package and then again an additional 3  massage package.  Looking forward to our next visit!"
"1","This is actually no longer the Wyndham, it is a Renaissance now. While the hotel looks nice and the rooms are modernly decorated, the walls are PAPER THIN. I always expect a little bit of noise staying in a hotel, but when the person in the next room is talking at a normal volume at 2am, I shouldn't wake up thinking there is a person in my room. Every word said in the neighboring rooms could be heard, including the \""you look sexy in red...\"" conversation. Even though I have no complaints about the other aspects of my stay, I wouldn't stay here again. \n\nAlso, Wi-fi is $13 a day."
"2","Un petit caf\u00e9 tr\u00e8s sympa qui fait aussi showroom, l'ambiance est d\u00e9contract\u00e9e, le menu est simple mais efficace, les prix sont plut\u00f4t bas pour le quartier, le service est cool et sympa . Cela change de certains caf\u00e9s branch\u00e9s hors de prix et qui ont tendance \u00e0 vous prendre un peu de haut parfois. Petit plus : une jolie terrasse \u00e0 l'arri\u00e8re qui permet de faire une pause hors de l'agitation !"
"2","Visited here awhile back. Was a nice experience, first time to visit. Very good art museum and gardens to compliment the views."
"2","Super clean!!!"
"1","I do not usually write reviews to restaurants but I do feel the need on this one. I had seen this restaurant on the food network as an undercover show and was very inspired by the owner that he would ever consider keeping an employee that was stealing from him but that's a whole different deal. Before going I had looked on yelp and their web site at the menu and reviews so I was really looking forward to going to a good Italian restaurant for a change. How ever that did not happen . My wife and i left California a couple of hours early to hopefully have lunch and check into our hotel as we pulled the parking lot the building seemed a little smaller than expected and the parking lot did not seem full at all we arrived at about 12:30 pm as we walked in we were not greeted by any employees working in fact the exact opposite we were totally ignored as one of the waiters walked within  five feet of us and said nothing at that point we started to look around the restaurant a little closer and noticed at least ten tables that had not been cleared with only about five or six tables being used after waiting about five min to get noticed and tired of the chef yelling that orders were up we left very disappointed really too bad we really wanted to try there food long way to drive for nothing we ere there. Sunday 3-24-13"
"1","Really not great. I would probably go as to far to say the worst Indian restaurant I have ever eaten at, and I have been to some truly horrendous ones! \n\nI came here last month with a couple of friends, against our better judgement as it was completely empty at about 7 in the evening, but we still dined here. The food was really not tasty, I had onion bhaji's to start which were dry and tasteless, and my friends had a selection of kebabs which they said were chewy, and they really looked unappealing. The curries were equally awful. I had the chicken bhuna, which had a super watery sauce, and the chicken was really chewy and stringy, and there was a layer of oil on the whole thing making it taste rank to be honest. The rice was also over cooked and was pretty soggy. To their credit though, the nan bread was tasty was was the best part of the meal - but it would be pretty difficult to mess that up! \n\nThe meal was really expensive too, with two courses coming to about \u00a317 - really not worth it. I found the staff rude and unhelpful, and overall had a pretty nasty experience. Don't be fooled - just because a restaurant is on the Royal Mile does not mean it is good, I learnt the hard way!"
"2","My family and I went to this buffet as part of the Buffet of Buffets package. Of the seven different buffet options this by far was the best. The quality of the food was great. The food options are a little bit limited as compared to other buffets, but everything they serve was cooked right. The desert bar was extensive with the best creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e I have tasted. This buffet also offers fresh crepes which can be topped with your choice of toppings. Get there early because the line can get long. It could take upwards of an hour before you get seated. Definitely a \""Don't Miss in Las Vegas\""!"
"2","PROS:\n1. Cheap eats!! You get your bang for your buck here. Lots of meaty & vegetarian options.\n\n2. Food is yummy. Their mango lassi is made with HOMEMADE yogurt which makes it really tasty.\n\nCONS:\n1. The silver platter thingy awkwardly sits on top of a tray.\n\nOVERALL:\n-Go here for a casual meal. I prefer this place than the indian buffet places around mtl."
"2","I wanted my first time to be in NYC, but I still had a great time at Serendipity 3 in LV.  I guess there's always a wait no matter what city you're in.  They only take RSVP 2 hrs. in advance at the earliest.  It was very windy the day my group and I went & everyone who waits, has to wait outside.  There was only 1 heat lamp next to the outdoor hostess (which you're not able to stand next to, but that doesn't matter b/c you can barely feel the heat since there is a tube around the stream of fire - probably for the drunkards who might decide to actually touch the flame).  \n\nANYWAYS,  once we got seated indoors, the atmosphere seemed very open and whimsical-like.  The menus were HUGE & I was having a hard time trying to decide on what to chow down on.  Our waiter helped me with that and I went with the Crab Cake Burger.  Once it arrived it looked AMAZING and it tasted just that.  It came with a side of fries (I ordered steak) & a really yummy dipping sauce.  The burger came with arugula and bacon, too!  YUM!  Unfortunately, I didn't have enough room for the Frozen Hot Chocolate :/  But I did manage to try a spoonful from my friend and it just reminded me of chocolate ice cream or chocolate ensure.  EH.  However, I'm willing to give the frozen hot chocolate another try... one day.  I would definitely come back for their Crab Cake Burger though!  \n\nFood my friends ordered - The Hangover Omelet (HUGE), The Sliders (comes w/ 3 of them & they look like nothing, but they apparently filled her up, but she had to order a side of fries), The Grilled Cheese which came with a side of tomato soup w/ goldfish sprinkled on top - cute (she said the sandwich was REALLY GOOD), and The Chicken Strips (comes w/ 3 dipping sauces).\n\nThe food IS on the pricey side, but the portions are huge."
"1","I stayed at the IP last week for a trade show I was attending at the Sands Convention Center.  I am not going to share anything here that the previous 85 reviews have not already said but maybe I can summarize.  \n\n-Friendly staff but in some cases understaffed.\n-Center Strip location.  Across from Cesar's, next to Harras and the Flamingo.\n-Monorail station attached to the hotel.\n-Older hotel.  Furniture and fixtures are from the early 80's\n-The IP does have an old, dingy appearance but from my experience it was clean.  Everything worked in my room. \n-Only a hand full of TV channels on the in-room TV. \n-Walking distance to the Sands Convention Center\n-Direct Monorail ride to the Las Vegas Convention Center.  \n-About half the cost of other hotels in the area. \n\nLet's face it.  You get what you pay for and the Imperial Palace is no exception.  I normally stay a places a bit nicer than this but on the other hand I saved $500 bucks over the five days I stayed there.  \n\nOverall It's a decent hotel in a very prime location."
"2","Went to get my shattered glass fixed on my galaxy note 3. Only took 3 hrs as promised. My phone is like new again!!"
"1","The kabob and food is ok, but they add food fillers and additives which makes you bloated and nauseated. Furthermore, they are a rip off restaurant. A group of us decided to eat here and they quoted us a fixed price for the buffett, soft drinks and deserts.  However, when they brought the bill they added extra price for soft drinks and we did not get any deserts as promised.  I would never go back to this establishment and would take my bussiness elsewhere with higher quality foods and honest service."
"1","Went here for breakfast day 1 arriving in Vegas to sum it up:\nMeh food.\nPretty good breakfast deal. \nSlow and forgetful service.\n\nIf you want more detail read on.\n\nWe were drawn to the restaurant by the promise of a good breakfast deal which is what we got. The food was cheap and just general diner breakfast food nothing very special but nothing objectionable. The worst part was the service. Service was super slow and took very long to come take our order or get refills on our drinks. Keep in mind this was at like 10 AM and the restaurant was near empty. The waitress had to be reminded multiple times to bring sugar/cream to the table. I am sure this place makes decent enough food but the wait times to just get a simple breakfast and get out were too long for any rational person to bear."
"1","First time I went here it was great.  I just went today for the second time and it was terrible.  I told her not too thin.  She almost took my entire eyebrow off.  When I complained to her she tried to defend herself.  I am getting married in a few months. They better grow back by then!  When I told the girl checking out she didn't care.  Won't be back!"
"2","I have been to a lot of buffets in Vegas, including Bellagio, Wynn, Rio Seafood buffet, Mandalay Bay, etc, and I have to say this is the best new buffet in Vegas. It's almost half the price of Bellagio and Wynn and the food is just as good. \n\nThe prime rib is amazing, probably one of the best prime rib served at a buffet. The desserts' selection is crazy, and your buffet includes all you can drink wine and beer. Do I really need to say anything else?\n\nThe only reason this place doesn't have 5 stars is of course the wait. The fact that this place is so good is not a well kept secret. This place is really popular on the weekends and wait can get up to 2+ hours. So it might be a good time to get a player's card at M resort. If you collect enough points you can get VIP passes to the front of the line. \n\nOn a side note M resort is also a really good place to stay. Rooms are cheap, service is excellent, their spa is amazing (so I hear from a friend), and you might be able to get ahead in line for the buffet."
"1","Let me start this review by saying that there is a lot of really cool stuff in this store. The small store in Downtown Container park is stocked with gorgeous original artwork of pretty much any Disney character you can think of. They also have some really cute figurines and other collectables. If you are a Disney fan, this place really is a must stop. And if you have some money to burn, you might find yourself taking something home.\n\nIf you can physically take it home, that is. If you are visiting Las Vegas on vacation, as people are known to do from time to time, and want them to ship a purchase home to you well ... not so much. And here in lies the reason behind me giving out a VERY rare one-star review.\n\nAs I was exploring DTCP, I decided to stop in the Disney Fine Art store to look around. It was the day before Valentine's Day, and I thought I might find something here for my wife, who is a huge Disney fan. Most of the store is filled with really cool original paintings ... they're not cheap, but they have some fantastic pieces. I didn't see anything that I felt confident my wife would like, so I was hesitant to pull the trigger on an expensive piece of artwork. But I noticed these cute figurines in the back. They had one that was Kermit and Miss Piggy dining together ... my wife LOVES the Muppets, especially Kermit, so I thought this would be a perfect gift, and was entirely affordable and reasonable at $25. I asked the attendant working if they could ship it to me and she noted that it came in a box that would keep it safe. But I was doing carry-on only and was already tight on space, and I didn't want to risk it being broken, so I paid an extra $8 to have it delivered. I gave them my home address, paid with my credit card, and got a crappy handwritten receipt, plus an e-receipt via Square. \n\nAfter a couple of weeks went by I never received either a package, nor a message from the store stating that the package was shipped, with a tracking number provided. I called the store and got a guy who was very nice and apologetic and took my information, said he would look into it, and would call me back immediately with a status update. \n\nA couple of weeks pass again, and I've heard nothing. I don't have time to track down things I've already paid for and figure out why they haven't been shipped to me yet, so I wrote it off as a lost cause. But I figured I'd give them another chance. I called again and spoke to a lady who said she was the new store manager and that they had been busy planning a new store opening, and she was just gaining an understanding of what had been done there, etc. I didn't need to hear her story, but she sounded sincere, apologetic, and seemed like someone who had their stuff together. Finally, I thought, I'll be able to get this really cool gift that my wife would LOVE and that I have paid for delivered to me. The lady found my information on file, apologized for it \""slipping through the cracks\"" and would contact me back by close of business with a tracking number.\n\nSo guess what happened next? If you guessed nothing ... DING DING DING, you're today's big winner. I waited about 5 days, heard nothing, and filed a dispute for a refund through my credit card company. \n\nAgain, let me stress that the merchandise they sell here is fantastic - some really cool stuff. If you live in the Las Vegas area and can buy and take the merchandise home that day - and afford it - you will be happy. But if they can't ship a product I bought onsite, and paid to have shipped, within a month then they should think about making their one store function properly before opening others."
"2","Loved it!!! Seafood is my favorite. Had the \""Kitchen Sink\"" and it was amazing. Service was wonderful. I would recommend this restaurant to my family and friends."
"1","N9NE was, in short, a disappointing experience.  I have absolutely no problem spending $50 on a good steak but N9NE was simply not a $200 per couple dining experience.\n\nThe ambiance was not that of a high end steakhouse.  It is as if you are in a nightclub with loud top 40 music playing and mirrored pillars.  There's a way to blend trendy and classy (I enjoy it when it works), however this was well over the top.   This was trendy cheesey.  Example - The drunk patrons at the next table to our left kept \""singing\""  (or better yet screaming and grunting) along to the music as if it was karaoke.  The couple making out at another table next to ours completed the experience - did they order any food or were they just dining on each other's faces all night?\n\nOur server was beyond pretentious and pompous during his chore of waiting on us.  And honestly, there was no reason to be.  I almost pulled him over at one point to tell him to cut the act, I've dined at restaurants with much more class than this one and the service does not need to be this way.  Of course I held back hoping that the food would make up for the atmosphere and service.  \n\nWhile the food was okay, I wouldn't say it blew me away by any means.  Everyone's' steaks were good but the oysters on the half shell were tiny and the lobster on the surf and turf was decidedly bad.\n\nAt the end of the meal I was disappointed that I had wasted my time and money there....there are so many other restaurants in Vegas I would love to try.  I guess if you're staying at the Palms it might be a good choice (although I've heard Alize is good), but to make a trip out from the strip was pointless."
"1","This review is for the Mekong palace restaurant. Was not warmly welcomed the whole visit.  when I placed my order the waiter didn't know what I was talking about when I read exactly off the menu. The whole staff set up for lunch for themselves and ate at the next table over and forgot we were there making every request we had seem like a bother. Food is not fresh all from cans, saw it delivered."
"1","I have visited this establishment 4 times in the last 3 weeks, and that's only if you count the first time I visited the establishment each day.  3 out of the 4 times my order was wrong and I had to go back and have them correct my order.  I clearly asked for no beans and identified that it was a food allergy, so it was real important.  Each time I would find beans hidden in my food.  I am very disappointed with this location.  Others that I have been to are pretty good.  I will not be going back after today.  The employees are not even very apologetic when you go back and explain the issue.  Very Poor Customer Service."
"2","This is a awesome structure. 40 stories up and 360 view of the city. Great staff that is knowledgeable about the city, history and great recommendations for stuff throughout the city. During the day is great but, by night, it is alive with lights. Not expensive about 15.00 per person and always a must do for me."
"1","Maybe it's the Californian in me buuuut.....Not my place for Mexican Food and way understandable, its a restaurant inside of the Casino.  Meet up w/ some friends for Happy Hour...all I can say is that I'm picking out next happy hour spot\n\nCarne Asada Fries: smh, no honey, sorry these are NOT carne asada fries.  Potato Wedges w/ bland seasoned carne asada, w/ pico de gallo drizzled sour cream.  Sounds good right???? it was OK, carne asada fries shoild never and I mean NEVER be made w/ potato wedges - Knock it off\n\nSangria: to me, very water down\n\nChip & Salas: subpar salsa, and stale chips\n\nSuper OVERpriced for mediocre food, and that's me being nice about it.  But who goes to Pink Taco for the food??? You go for the atmosphere\n\nThis is only my opinion, go try it out for yourself and form your own opinion of Pink Taco"
"1","I have to say that the staff here was very friendly and courteous (they earned the 2 stars) but the food was just so-so. I ordered the cheeseburger and fries with a drink. I had heard that they had a really good burger and I like a really good burger. \n\nThe burger was seared nicely and had a nice grilled flavor. The lettuce and tomato were as nature intended, no more - no less. I was very disappointed in the bun. It was hard and crusty to the point of breaking when I tried to smash it down a bit.\n\nThey included a hush-puppy on the plate, which seemed a bit odd with a burger. I took a bite and immediately spit it into my napkin. It was like biting into old grease since the outside was soaked in whatever frying oil they used and amazingly the center was uncooked raw corn meal. \n\nThey had three sauces on the table and I squirted a bit out of the first and gave it a taste. I like either sweet and/or vinegary barbeque sauces. This was unlike anything I've experienced in any state that I've been in. And that's quite a few over the decades. This sauce was the most bitter and acrid sauce I've ever tasted and even after swishing soda in my mouth to try and clear my palate, the aftertaste was still there. It was not pleasant.\n\nAfter about 5 minutes and 10 drinks of soda later I tried the second sauce. It was just as bad as the first. I don't know if they had some bad batches or not, but there was no way I was trying the third sauce.\n\nLike I said, the staff was nice and the atmosphere was pleasant... but you can't eat ambiance."
"1","My appointment with Kelly was at 11:30am. I was there at 11:20am. When I walked in, she asked me if I had an appt and I said yes, at 11:30am.  She said well, I'm running behind, she said maybe 20min. \nThat's fine.  But 30min later she still had to foil half of this woman's head. \nShe clearly said yes to a color that she had no business taking when she had a haircut scheduled.  If anything, make the other woman wait and cut my hair first. \nSo, at noon, I said forget it, told her it was very unprofessional and rude and walked out. \nI can choose where I spend my money and it won't be at Kode ever again."
"2","I love this pet store! Always have, always will. And now that I've brought my kids here, they are die-hard fans as well.\n\nThe \""jungle\"" motif and aesthetic of this shop sets this store apart from other pet stores. Kudos to the architects and interior designers of this store, they did an amazing job with the interior. The attention to detail is great, and one can really feel that you're in a shop at Animal Kingdom at Disneyworld. Between the roped section by the cash and the \""wooden/bamboo\""-like walls, the store interior is really well done. \n\nMerchandise-wise, they seem to have everything you'd need to care for and pamper your dog/cat/hamster/gerbil/bunny/bird/fish/maybe other pet type...... I'm a dog person, so I tend to gravitate to the doggie areas. Wow. Amazing dog toys and the cutest dog coats ever! All the usual dog treats and snacks and more. Pricey, yes, but there are unique products here that I've not seen elsewhere (coats and toys, particularly). \n\nAnd they have animals here. Cute, adorable, I-have-to-take-them-home-immediately animals. Specifically, they have puppies, bunnies, hamsters, gerbils, mice and rats, birds and tons of fish here. Again, I gravitate to the dog area. I know the perils of getting dogs from pet stores, and how many pet stores often get their puppies from puppy mills, and how we're not supposed to get pets at pet stores and why, but I gotta say, the animals at this store appear to be very well cared for. The staff is knowledgable about the dogs here and seem to genuinely care for them. If you asked about the puppies' pedigree, they'd probably be able to provide you with the breeders' info."
"1","I don't know what was going on this Saturday but the food has taken a turn for the worse at C4. There was a Horse charity event taking place at the stage out the back but this was no excuse for the food we received there last night. This place has always been a favorite spot in Cave Creek but doubt we will go there again now on last nights performance. It was very quiet also and I don't know if this is a reflection of the food or what. The service was very good."
"2","Twice in a day they picked us up on time, took us to where we wanted to go (no longhauling) and with no delay and no fuss. Isn't that what a cab company should do? We'll use again."
"2","I stayed here for a week - and the cost is respectable for the duration of the week. The room size is decently sized with dual queen size beds. I had the deluxe room, and I picked whatever room was available during the check in process. I had a shared wall with a shared door - while I could hear people speaking, it was difficult to understand. I just drowned out the external noise with my laptop speakers. I did notice stains on my work chair - but I'm not going to complain too much about it. \n\nI just covered it with pillows to make the chair more ergonomic to work in. Without the pillows, the lack of ergonomics can be a concern for those who type a lot - it can become painful to the wrists or shoulders, or lower back if they are not aware of their body posture. The pillows does help out - but doesn't eliminate the problem. \n\nThe curtain does block all of the external light from entering the room, perfect for when I need absolute darkness for sleeping. The AC works well and there's a small fridge and a safe. I used the fridge to keep drinks cold - never did test the freezer capability. I did notice the lack of conveniently located electric outlets.  \n\nSeems that there were only one available in the most unusual spot, away from the work area, and away from any place to do any ironing. Speaking about ironing, the ironing board cover could be replaced - it's showing its age. \n\nThere are a few Starbucks located in the area. I counted two indoors and one outside. This hotel is located next to a 24/7 Walgreens, perfect for those trips to acquire basic traveling necessities. \n\nThe sound of the Siren show is annoying during the evening; the window could use better acoustic insulation. The noise from the hallway is noticeable - people in their drunken ways wondering through the hallways. Good thing I have ear plugs to remedy these noise issues. \n\nOverall, not a bad spot to stay in Vegas, and on The Strip as well. \n\nTip: Check-in process is a total mess during after 11AM, or even 3pm, or even 5pm. There's lots of people checking in. Suggestion for this, plan to wait a while in the lobby, or just drop your stuff off at the Bell Desk, go amuse yourself in Vegas, and come back later, such as 7pm or 9pm."
"1","Oh I hate this place.  Overpriced and crappy food.  For unknown reasons I have ended up here a few times.  Drunk, early riser, or hungover.  I'll give you the early bird perspective since that would be the most clear experience.  I paid $10 for a crappy mimosa and had a so so omelet.  I know this place looks inviting and convenient, but just walk a little bit and try elsewhere.  I didn't try the buffet, but it's probably about the same price."
"2","Several of my friends and I had lunch there yesterday. We hadn't been there in quite a while but the food is still awesome. My Larb  salad with ground pork was absolutely delicious. Lots of cilantro and line just the way I like it.\nThe Tom Yum Kai soup is perfect, couldn't be any better. We tasted each other's dishes and I have to say the Mongolian beef was out of this world. Will get that next time.  Everyone agreed that the Pad Thai was about as good as it could get.\nService here is wonderful, very attentive and very efficient. The decor  is truly beautiful. If the weather permits, and it usually will, sit outside on their courtyard - intimate and very comfortable. \nWe had forgotten how good this place can be.\n\nWe're going back for dinner next week so will post photos then."
"2","Incredible sandwich.  Great Service on the night that I was there.  Will definitely go back."
"2","This place has some good food and is a nice place to hang with friends after a good workout. I usually get a burger here and they come out pretty good. They have a bunch of beers on tap and the interior of the place is set up nicely. Live music some nights and a game room with darts and pool tables as well. The patio outside is great if you're a smoker (not me though). Prices are average to higher but at least it's going towards a real restaurant and not a chain."
"2","I've been to like 2 Vietnamese restaurants in my life, so I'm not an expert and can't compare this to anything else.  But I really liked the food and the flavors of this food.  I could see the menu being a little overwhelming but I asked some people who'd been before and checked the other Yelp reviews and decided on the following:\n\nBeef Chow Fun - Yum.  Greasy but excellent dish.  Kind of reminded me of Mongolian beef over noodles.   Fun indeed.\n\nSpicy Beef w/ Rice Noodles - Probably my favorite of the soups I tried.  This had a little bit more going on that just broth and noodles.  Good enough that at some point, I will crave a bowl and be back for it.\n\nFreshly Sliced Beef Pho - This was what I expected.  A kind of nicely flavored beef broth soup.  A little bland for me, but my kids LOVED it.\n\nPork Bun (pork and egg rolls on cold vermicelli noodles) - I was most surprised by this one.  Cold noodles and fish sauce makes me say \""meh,\"" but I really liked this dish.  Fish sauce and all.  Actually the sauce probably made the dish.\n\nAs everyone else has said, the places is pretty cheap.  Unlike everyone else... you can keep the darn spring rolls.  Egg roll... awesome.  Cold transparently wrapped bunches of tasteless lettuce... not so much."
"1","I dislike Mimi's Cafe.  I always have.  I decided that, after a few years of avoidance that they would improve.  I was dead wrong.  Mimi's is still meh.  I had breakfast there with my mother while my father was in surgery down the street.  I ordered croissants, which were delicious, but the actual meal of potatoes, bacon, and eggs was horrid.  It was chewy bacon with bland eggs and oily potatoes. \n\nEw.\n\nSorry, but I dislike Mimi's for many reasons, all of which relate to their food and sad service."
"2","Phenomenal! Food, staff and ambiance is impeccable! We had the filet, ham chop, cream corn and the potato gratin. I recommend them all! The banana cream pie was too die for and the special dessert was a brownie trifle with ice cream and marshmallow fluff, I ate until I was almost sick it was so great! Come here with an appetite and you won't be disappointed!"
"2","Mmmm Organic food ... wait what!?  Yeah I can't say I know the difference in taste.  I guess my palate is not as popping as I say it is -- or maybe there's real no difference!  I can appreciate the idea.  However, the organic part just sounds better and sophisticated.  I eat organic only a-har a-har a-har.  Picazzo's Organic Kitchen is a great selling tool.  Though I can't bash their pizza, it's actually pretty good.  I love their crust is that \""organic\""?  Gotta get their bacon bleu cheese wedge salad -- it's a must.  Organic Bacon?  Ambience makes you feel smarter too -- or maybe I'm that already :)  Service was great, my server recommended a small since it's actually a large :)  Do \""organic\"" food appear more hmmm... - Enjoy!"
"2","A couple of my co-workers have been talking about coming here , but none of us have made the attempt until now.  My wife and i moved to Vegas 3 months ago and everything around town to us just seemed so... plain.   When we walked in to Rambo's my wife and i were extremely surprised as to the decor.  I actually really liked it. I grew up listening to music from the 60's  ( my dad was kind of a hippy ). \n\nWe started with the fried mushrooms .. these were not the ordinary little tiny button mushrooms. These were pretty large and full size.  They came with a light batter with Parmesan cheese and ranch dressing. They were delightful!\n\nI ordered a Rambo burger ( cheese inside , burger , pulled pork and a huge onion ring ) and let me tell you , the flavor was amazing. There was not one flavor that overwhelmed the other.  The cheese was just the right amount.  It came with fresh cut fries with skin on , and i opted for the potato salad.  Fries were yummy , but i wasnt a fan of the Potato Salad.  \n\nMy wife ordered a Turkey Avocado Croissant with fries.  She was in heaven. She explained that the croissant was fluffy and buttery , the meat delectable.  One of the best she has in quite a while. \n\nWe ended the meal with a piece of fresh made red velvet cake. It tasted like it was made with vanilla frosting ( my preference anyway ) but after talking with one of the owners it was a lightly whipped cream cheese ( can i have the recipe please ! ) \n\nAll in all a great meal.  It set us back less than 30 dollars ( not including tip) \n\nService was excellent , the waitress ( Emily ? )  was extremely friendly , knew the menu well and even offered us books and playing cards while the food was being cooked.   It wasnt the fastet food in town , but good food sometimes takes a little bit longer. \n\nDefinitely will be back !"
"2","This is my favorite course in the greater Phoenix area. The course is challenging, and the views are amazing!\n\nThis course is one that for some reason is generally overlooked as one of the best (in my opionion the best)  course in Phoenix. It is off the beaten path a lttile, (sitting in Fountain Hills) but is really worth the extra 10 minuet drive. Staff is excellent, The last 6 holes (the Wicked 6) are a fresh idea in ending a course, and I enjoy it thuroughly. \n\nThe practice green is well kept, and is a great determination of how the course greens are. The chipping green is one of my favorites in town.\n\nCart girls are friendly, and always smiling. Prices are just right!\n\nIm always coming back, and they never give me a reason to not come back!"
"2","I love, love, LOVE Xtreme Sushi. It's the best AYCE sushi I have ever tasted. Like previous Yelpers have stated, lunch is $20 and dinner is $25. Not bad, that's the usual so there's no surprise there. AYCE includes EVERYTHING on the menu except sashimi which is alright with me because I don't each much sashimi.\n\nI go here everytime I visit Vegas. I wish there was one in San Diego because after eating here, nothing really compares. SO IF THE OWNER OF XTREME SUSHI IS READING THIS, PLEASE OPEN ONE IN SAN DIEGO!!\n\nThe employees are so nice and welcoming. The service is always great.\nOne cool thing about this place is that you can order half orders of rolls and salads so you don't get full off of one roll or a full salad during your AYCE stay. I have never seen any other sushi place do that before.\n\nI would definitely give this place 10 stars if I could, but 5 is my limit. I highly recommend this place."
"2","Spent all day at 2 pool stores in mesa trying to replace my older single speed pool pump. Went round and round with one store trying to find a rebuilt motor that would fit with no luck. Went to another mesa store and they had nothing that would fit either, and I wasn't ready to splurge for the 1000 plus dollar variable speed system. \n\nB and B had the exact pump I needed, right size, everything and it was new not rebuilt. Cheaper than the Mesa store rebuilds too!  I wish I would've gone here first instead of spending 5+ hours at their competitors in Mesa!  \n\nThis will be my go to store in the future!"
"2","So I was out in Scottsdale early on a Thursday night.. where to go? Well we just wanted to be drinking, so I looked up dive bars on Yelp (this being Old Town Scottsdale I didn't expect anything wonderful). Well I was surprised when we ended up at DJ's.\n\nThe guy at the door was half way through Braveheart, so that should tell you pretty much all you need to know about the place. There were about 4 people in the whole bar, a sad little Marlboro dispenser with a tv screen that kept playing ads with cowboys on horses - hello how sad for someone that wants a cigg at the bar! It must be torture for some people.\n  \nThey had a few HDTVs playing golf, so you could see each drop of sweat on Tiger Wood's face - literally you could! I don't really enjoy such things.\n\nWell I ordered a Cran Vodka, and it was standard fair... you know with the cranberry juice, that is unnaturally red... like Hawaiian Punch brand red. Well it was decent, not too strong but not weak I suppose. Then after having been whining earlier about how I couldn't do shots, I did one of Absolute LA. I had wanted to try it since I love Acia. But I usually hate flavored vodka, even blueberry, so it could have been awful. But it wasn't, especially since the bartender shook it in ice before hand.\n\nOverall, we got drunk and they didn't charge us an arm or a leg! A great save, thank you mobile Yelp."
"1","This place sucks.  Period.  I'm a big fan of buffet, and frankly this place is what makes people hate buffets.  Never again."
"2","My husband and I came here on his lunch break, and was greeted right away, the Manager walked up and I asked what I was thinking about  getting and I told him that I ALWAYS get the smokehouse sub but wanted to try something different! He suggested a sub and I told him I'll just stick to the same sub so he offered to split his sub w me just so I can try it.... Wow!!! Now that's how u keep a customer coming back!!  Not to mention everyone is super nice always happy and if u enjoy trying different hot sauces they have over 25 different sauces!!!!"
"2","Anyone who wants to go here....sign me up as your arm candy.  This place was fantastic for what it is.   You can call it Mexican but its not your typical corporate-menu Mexican fare.  The menu is full of ceviches, tortas, and large aguas frescas served in ridiculously large margarita glasses.  \n\nI rocked the \""Hawaiian\"", my date rocked the \""Mexican.\""   We had a little ceviche tostada on the side, washed it all down with a pina colada and found ourselves in heaven.  \n\nThey will be seeing this guy again."
"2","I attended an event here last night called nerdy dancing and it was amazing! The club is very big and perfect for some booty shakin! The music was awesome... they played a lot of Hip Hop which I looooved. The bartenders were very good looking and nice surprisingly since most of the bartenders on the strip are a bunch of A holes. The servers were also very attentive and polite. I hung out in the dance area upstairs and the view was beautiful you can see the dancing water at the Bellagio across the strip. I cant wait to go back to this place!"
"1","Agonizingly slow service. Tepid, mediocre food. Salsa from a jar."
"1","I love coming here but today decided to come for lunch and worst service we were sat right away but then no one came to check on us for about 15 min then a bus boy came to check on us and said \""I'm not your waiter but ill get you drinks\"" we said who is then and he said \""I dont kno,were trying to figure that out.  They cut a lot of people and that's why we are short handed. \"" he was great and ended up waiting on us the whole time. He needs a raise if it werent for him I would say I would never come back.  I dont blame him for bit checking on us since I'm sure this isn't his usual duties."
"2","Deana is an awesome hair stylist!! I have for years drove 3 hrs to have my hair done!! She is flexible with her hours and fit me in last min I a Friday afternoon!! Even as messed up and dry as my hair was she fixed it and made me look beautiful again!! I would recommend her to anyone!!!"
"1","I was not impressed with this clinic. \nPros:\n1. The vet did tell us where to find pet meds for a cheaper price\n\nCons: \n1.Their website was not up to date as far as their location and address. \n2. The staff was not very friendly. \n3. I felt very rushed to get in and out \n4. Received a card in the mail and thought it might be a welcome note but it was a request for referrals!"
"1","Very bad service and management., they are very bad food was ok but service was really mean I like the Scottsdale,AZ better"
"2","I drove by this place many times...looking at the all-you-can-eat tue and thur meals.  Well I finally took the bait.  As I entered the place, I was surprised with amount of items on the walls...I thought it was in good taste, but I am sure others will find it tacky.  The food was above average but not the best I have ever had.  The chicken was smokey and moist...the ribs were good, but a few on the dry side.  Waitstaff very nice and attentive.  Great night...I'll be back."
"1","Wife and I had the Chicken Kabob plate. Very disappointed. The chicken was dry and flavorless. The saffron rice was cold.\nThe place is very spacious and clean. Service was prompt. No one asked how the meal is. \nProbably won't go back there again. Too bad, I really enjoy mid-eastern cuisine."
"2","We regularly eat here. It is a very \""easy\""  and casual dining experience. the food is and sevice is consistant.  We love the sizzling salmon and the  chinesechicken salad.\nThe tai mai drink is very potent! very friendly staff.  They are great about altering orders too--special requests."
"2","It's almost the end of the month and we're trying to use up those Entertainment Book coupons.  The 2008 version has three coupons for Siena Bistro and we've been meaning to check out their menu.  Last night provided the perfect opportunity.\n\nIt's a bit tricky getting there, thank goodness for the Magellan!  But when you do finally drive up to this place, you'll feel so far away from the busy lifestyle of Las Vegas because after all, it is located on a golf course.\n\nWe did a quick check of the menu to make sure there was something we both liked and immediately found a few choices that stood out.  The waiter told us to sit wherever we liked, and the Big F was immediately drawn outside to the fireplace.  After initially seating at one of the inside tables, the waitress asked if we wanted to sit outside since she noticed the Big F had taken a peek.  \n\nAs we chose our table closest to the fireplace, the waitress quickly set up our table and brought a candle out.  We almost had the outside seating all to ourselves this evening, which was nice.  (The other couple that did sit outside were so engrossed in themselves that it still felt like it was just us!)\n\nThe menu had  a nice variety of choices, without being overly expensive either.  After we made our choices, the waitress asked if we wanted any bread and butter, which we immediately said yes to.\n\nThe bread took awhile, and we were starving.  But it came out warm - crusty cheese bread rolls with melted Parmesan that were pretty grub.  We each had two and asked for more!\n\nOur entrees were soon to arrive.  We shared: \n\n* Peppered New York Steak ($19) \""12 oz 5 blended peppercorn marinated bone-in New York steak, caramelized onions,  melted bleu cheese crumble, Garlic whipped potatoes, chef's vegetables, and drizzled with a delicate demi-glace.\""  This dish not only looked great, but had so many complementing flavors going on.  The crispiness of the fried onions, the sweetness from the caramelized red onions, the bold taste of the melted bleu cheese, the creaminess of the mashed potatoes, and a pretty tasty piece of beef with peppercorns hidden throughout the meal.  The asparagus and carrots also added to this dish.  I was pretty impressed with this order.\n\n* T-Bone Lamb Chops ($18) \""2 pan seared 4 oz T-bone lamb chops served with an herb roasted tomato, and white beans.\""  I think I was so focused on the lamb chops part that I missed the 't-bone' part on the menu.  (They also have Lollipop Lamb Chops on the menu too.)  So, I was a bit more surprised when my order came out.  Two chops sat on a bed of white beans with two herb-stuffed Roma tomatoes resting alongside.  The chops were good, but missed something.  It helped with the sweetness of the tomatoes, but I think the white bean concoction drowned out the dish.  It reminded me more of a cassoulet because of the white beans.  I thought the beans were going to be more of a side dish than resting on the whole plate. \n\nService was decent, considering they were quite busy and we sat outside.  A lot of older people dine here, perhaps because of its location?  We wondered what it would be like during the day so you could check out the view which I'm sure would be gorgeous.\n\nOverall, we were surprisingly pleased.  We saw a few other dishes on our way out and it looked pretty good.  We're still trying to find a way to squeeze in another meal there before our coupon expires.\n\n3.5 stars.\n\n(Pics of our dinner are posted!)"
"1","Went to Guedos for the first time today and was really disappointed.  The food was terribly over priced and all normal sides are ala carte to your entree.  Rice and beans are an expensive add-on and are  served in styrofoam dishes.  You have to pay extra for chips and salsa as well.  I spent $20 for a meal that would have been no more than $11 at a  better quality restaurant.  The burro I had was fairly bland and tasteless, the beans were alright but nothing special and the rice not good at all.  I would have enjoyed taco bell much more at 1/3rd the price.  Glad some like this place.  The owner seems like a nice guy, but Imho, the prices and food quality are a deal breaker."
"1","Big City Bagels is somewhere between a bagel cafe and Einstein.  They don't have all the trappings of a cafe (no egg salad, none of that)  but they do have nice normal bagel flavors and the bagels were slightly better than Einstein.  \n\nThey have a huge Snapple fridge which excited me, but alas, no regular Snapple.  Why is everything diet here?  I don't get it."
"1","I hate to do this.  I love the food and the service is great when you eat in but try and place an order by phone or email, which they may or may not answer, and good luck getting a response or your food at a promised time.   When it happened the first time I called it a fluke but when it happened again today I went back to Mix Zone where they answer phones, have a delivery person and deliver in the promised time."
"1","Don't come here!!!! WORST customer service ever! Bar tender is the manager and is pathetic. Refused to open a bottle of Grey Goose that was clearly on the shelf. They only care about making money and spanking people who don't finish their burgers! What a waste of my time!"
"2","Got a dozen donuts but I couldn't try them all!  What I did get to try:  Maple Bacon, What-A- Joy, Campfire Smorez, Apple Fritter and raspberry filled is what I was able to try so far.  \nMaple Bacon is good, just like it sounds.  It has a maple top filling with bacon bits on top.  I didn't care for the top filling of the doughnut, but the bacon bits make it work.  Still wasn't bad, just wasn't my favorite out of the ones I tried.\nWhat-A- Joy, it's very chocolaty - which nothing is wrong with that just makes it all the better :). This was my co-worker's favorite. I believe this is made to mock the Almond Joy candy...well not mock but to mimic.  I don't like coconut usually but this surprisingly good.  \n I LOVE the smores...it tastes like smores.  It has a marshmallow filling that is soooo yummy, I had to dip some of the What-A-joy donuts in there because I like the filling.  Probably will get another one next time I stop by.  \nApple Fritter- this was the least sweet out of the ones I tried.  Still good, I didn't taste chucks of apples or anything...I've never had this kind of donut before so wasn't sure how it's supposed to taste but it's a little sweet like some cinnamon but wasn't overwhelming.\nThe Raspberry filled donuts is just like your regular filled donuts.  Looks like they use real preservatives though because I see the seeds in the filling of the donuts.  Yum.  It's sugar coated instead of glazed as some places make their jelly filled.  \n\nDefinitely worth checking it out.  I tried mostly their Gourmet Doughnuts.  The two that weren't were the What-A-Joy and raspberry filled.  \n\nThe location was in a gas station which I felt was a little old, but it works.  It seems clean..  There was only one staff member there, and she was very nice and helpful, suggesting some doughnuts to try as it was my first time there and giving me what people usual order and what her favorites were.  \n\nOverall great find, glad there is one near me and I don't have to drive to North area to try these!!"
"1","When you see an almost empty restuarant at 7 pm on a Sarurday night in the busiest retail location in metro Phoenix, it should be a hint about something. Unfortunately we forgot about that and chose it anyway. \n\nVery poor food with amateur level service. They can not survive for long this way."
"2","they were friendly; did the work in an hour and I was done.  great experience."
"2","Dr Brooker is one of the most thorough, patient and detailed people I have ever met. Not just Doctor's. Being a person who wanted to improve eyesight through Lasik technology, it was a process to get my eyes in position to benefit from the procedure. Dr Brooker delicately walked me through this process for several months. he was clear about all the benefits and more importantly risks associated. \n\nAlso something to note, personally I never felt and pressure from Dr Brooker and felt his sole purpose was to educate and guide me through the process of maintaining healthy eyes.\n\nHe's more than a 5 star.\n\nNevada"
"2","Pamela's was awsome I went there just about a year ago exact and I had flapjacks and chorizo   and the food came as soon as we ordered it meaning very fast can't go wrong with it even with an out of towner like myself!"
"1","This is a bit different review then the rest.  \n\nWe rented it out for a christmas party for our group.  They had drinks, food, space and music.  It was a great space the food was actually amazing, truffle fries, mini burgers, stuffed mushrooms and more.  The food was replenished often and kept warm on hot plates.\n\nIt was a drink ticket night, I am cool with that but the bartender was insanely conservative.  By the way I used to serve at the races in january so I know the deal. I felt like he added a thimble of booze to each drink, he would take a empty plastic glass (at least pour into a shot glass and pour a bit of booze into my glass.  Not as many people showed up so most people had many extra tickets.  Needless to say I was sober even though I had a sober driver.\n\nCome on add a tiny bit of extra booze not just to the line and if you are worried about your bosses getting mad.  My past bartending experience is you pour your drinks over ice to make it look like there is more not into an empty cup when my mind stays sober.  Mind over matter..."
"2","This place may be closed now.  I drove by the building and they had a big banner advertising a cheap breakfast, so I'm not sure if it's Galerias anymore..."
"2","This is an outstanding service company. They are polite and prompt on the phone. They gave a fair estimate and sound advice. Their crew arrived on time and prepped the exterior with great attention to detail. They finished in one day and the look is amazing. The clean up was just as professional as the prep. They are THE company to use for your painting needs."
"2","Nice middle-eastern place near CMU.\nI usually get the 'Vegetarian Special' which is box with rice, hummus and baba ganoush (and bread). They also have awesome 'Sleek' which is this awesome concoction of kale, onions and beans.. tried it for the first time today and loved it.\nThe owner seems to really care about his food... always reminds me to hold box the right way when I get take-out.. seems like he really knows his middle-eastern food.\nAwesome place, but a bit on the pricier end, I could get a more diverse platter of food for cheaper at the middle-eastern truck at margaret morrison st."
"2","Don't just drive past this place! Yes, it looks like your average fast-food-joint-converted-into-Mexican-taco-stand. From the outside.\n\nGo in and you are first greeted by the staff who smile and say hi as they bustle through their food prep (they're also filling drive-thru orders). And you look around--the place has charm. They've put in their own furniture--kind of modified benches/tables that feel like a comfier upgraded fast food set-up. There's some decor, the place has a feel, maybe even some plants. Your senses tell you this is NOT just a taco joint or fast food.  And take a look into the kitchen, which is all open for you to check out. It's shiny, clean and fresh-looking. You're excited about what will come out of there.\n\nI had told my friends that, according to Yelp, the tacos were huge. The guy behind the counter was fixing one up. He saw us staring and held it up for us. He saw the awe in our faces. He smiled and said, 'Half pound of meat.\"" \n\nWe got a variety of tacos in our party  (each of us only needed one). It comes half wrapped in paper like an In&Out burger, and it's good that it does. It's thick and full of juicy stuff piling out the back. I chose the carne asada--pretty awesome. My friends liked the agua frescas, too.\n\nI wish I had a taco joint like this near where I live. I'd make it my regular go-to. The food is lightning fast, but I'd even be tempted to hang out a little."
"2","If your ever in Scottsdale you must try this hip and colorful breakfast spot.  The food is excellent with many unique choices and surprisingly if your in the mood for a lunch time drink they have great mixed drinks. The only downfall may be a few of the waitresses fall short on superb service but my family found one server that is head and shoulders above all others so be sure to request a server named Briana who makes us feel like we are exclusively catered too. Overall you surely will not be disappointed with the food, service, and vibrant atmosphere."
"2","It's not about quantity with the brunch/lunch buffet, but it is about the quality. I haven't been happier with a quality buffet for $22.00 ever. We went on a weekday and actually savored the food. I'm known for ground and pound on some of buffets, but this was not one of those times. Almost everything comes in its own serving dish, bowl, etc., so that means less mess too. I got a complimentary Bloody Mary with the meal (you get that or a Mimosa). \n\nThe salad bar has quite a few choices. We tried their Caesar, and a few others. All were tasty and really fresh. They had some amazing salami's, and Italian meats, as well as shrimp cocktail that is portioned out with two shrimp and sauce. \n\nThe fried chicken wings were crispy, yet juicy and perfectly seasoned. The red beans and rice were flavorful and brought back memories of Louisiana. The fish was perfectly prepared, moist yet cooked thoroughly.  The Asiago stuffed gnocchi was amazing. The macaroni and cheese was exceptional with bread crumbs on top. The only thing I wasn't too amazed with was their Chinese food, so pass on that.\n\nThe dessert bar is crazy. They have 18 flavors of gelato and you can ask for really small scoops to maximize your tasting adventure. \n\nThis was the best buffet I've had in Vegas for the price."
"2","Great job repairing my leather tool bags. Was very fast and efficient at what I felt was a VERY reasonable price. Thanks and I highly recommend using this place."
"2","Aerogelic Ballooning has always been one of my favorite ballooning companies in the Phoenix area.  I've previously worked for 2 separate broker companies partnering with Aerogelic Ballooning and our customers consistently gave great reviews and never a complaint for this hot air balloon company.  \n\nI would highly recommend Aerogelic Ballooning to my friends, family, and even my current boss who lives in Glibert.  He may actually be getting an Aerogelic Ballooning Gift Certificate from me this year for Christmas!  \n\nCompared to other hot air balloon companies that operate in the Phoenix area, Aerogelic offers a very personable experience.  With smaller baskets than some of their competition, Aerogelic's balloon rides provide great visibility and tons of fun.  \n\nI had the pleasure of meeting up with Aerogelic's owner in Albuquerque where he invited me to dine with his family and crew over breakfast after a morning flight.  The crew is loyal knowledgeable, and always strive for the best customer experience that can be provided."
"1","You could go here, but you would be better off taking a cheese grater to your nipple.\n\nDo you enjoy standing at the counter for 20 minutes just waiting to order? Do you like your order always being screwed up? Do you like it when an employee tells you that they are out of something 15 minutes after you ordered it?\n\nThen I have the place for you!!!!!!"
"1","We decided to blow some money on bottle service - i talked to a security guy and he called down the host who hooked us up. They were actually pretty nice and took care of us quickly. The night was enjoyable up until shit went down. One of my friends went to use the bathroom, and I was sitting with our bags. At some point I turned to talk to someone - LITERALLY no more than 30 seconds. In that time frame someone grabbed our bags right out from under my nose. What followed was an hour of trying to track them down and running around to security desks. Thankfully security had gotten hold of our bags and brought them back to us - but ALL of our cash was stolen. That was shitty, but not the end of the world. What makes me angry is how rude security was to us when we reported it. Honestly, I was not expecting to see that money again. But the guy was such a dick to us about taking a chance on reporting it. We had just dropped $500 on VIP service, and they treated us like assholes. The security guy just kept saying stuff like \""well, that's why you never carry cash\"" and \""you should know better than to leave your things unattended.\"" No kidding dude, but we didn't come to you for a lecture. \n\nSo, if you come to this place, keep a very keen eye. And, if god forbid something happens, expect to get treated like shit by security.  I'm not an idiot - I know that money is long gone. I'm glad I got all of my other stuff back. BUT for security to treat us that way after we gave the club all that money is a bigass thumbs down."
"1","Purchased the Groupon for the tri-pak of oils which they were out of.  Was told they would arrive in 15 minutes, waited 20 minutes and left.  Waste of a trip, guess they couldn't come up with a solution to give me another product to subsitute what they didn't have.  Ruined my experience to ever go there again."
"2","We had appetizer sampler, three cup black cod, the \""diver's scallop\"", lemon chicken.  The cod sauce was \""to die for\"" and the scallops were so tender and succulent!  The drinks were well poured.  Overall, 5 stars and that's because the overall food quality and spicing was excellent and spot-on.  AND the cod and scallops were phantastic [sic]!"
"1","$5.99 breakfast steak and eggs...\n\nTheir version of steak is 4 thin slices of beef.\nBest part is the potatoes.\nTheir french toast is not great.\n\nGreat price, but you get what you pay for.\nSave money and don't be expecting anything tasty."
"2","Returned to My Florist for breakfast w/friends.  One friend and I always struggle w/the sweet vs. savory breakfast choice, so we frequently end up ordering one of each and splitting our orders.  We opted for this at My Florist.  We ordered the brioche French toast and the build-your-own omelette.  We got the omelette with gruyere cheese, spinach and bacon.  The portions were huge.  We each got a slice of toast w/real butter, half an order of gruyere scalloped potatoes, half a serving of fresh fruit, half of an enormous omelette, and 2 slices of French toast.  Our server had no problem bringing an extra plate for our meal, which makes splitting orders less messy.  Our coffee, water and ice tea were topped off continuously.  I can't say enough about the omelette.  It had big chunks of bacon, tons of spinach, and gooey melted cheese.  Fabulous!  Real butter and real maple syrup also get a big thumbs-up from me.  If only they had fresh-squeezed orange juice."
"1","This place is awful. One roll cost almost $17 and was the same quality sushi you would get at Von's. You can get better sushi at a convenience store. Avoid this place."
"2","North Mountain Preserves \n\nNow that the cooler weather is here it's time to dust off the hiking boots and hit the trails. You can head in any direction in the valley and get to some great hiking spots. The North Mountain Preserve area is located south of Thunderbird from 19th Ave to Cave Creek Road and has numerous trails marked for any type of interest. Two of the trails I have successfully navigated are Shaw Butte (Trail 360) and North Mountain (Trail 44). Shaw Butte is a 4 mile trek with trail designation of multi-use, meaning bikers, runners and hikers share the path -- and are used by all. With various fitness and skill levels it makes it easy just to get out and enjoy. The view from the top is very impressive and the trail meanders around the peak to view the whole valley. \n\nOn one hike I couldn't find parking at Shaw Butte, went around the corner and parked at North Mountain. This trail is shorter but steeper and is paved most of the way. This works a different set of muscles due to the incline. Give these hikes a whirl if you want to change your view of the valley."
"2","Beautiful cafe at an amazing location. I love that I can walk here easily from my house. Food was delicious and the pop tart was awesome! My only complaint is that the coffee cups do not have handles, I felt like a dog trying to drink out of a water bowl. Not sure why they make you drink your coffee out of a soup bowl?! Food is great, service is superb, but I'll bring my own mug next time."
"2","Best banh mi's in Phoenix metro! Pretty cheap too! The French bread, liver paste and fillings make this an all-around great Viet sandwich!\n\nThey do Euro deli's too, but it's more worth it to come for the Viet sandwiches.  It's a clean and spacious place.  Most people order to go.  They also serve other Viet snacks and drinks too!\n\nCome try if you have not!"
"1","I used A&R Appliance Repair for many years and was satisfied. My house was going on the market so had them come for a few repairs. One burner on my Gas Cooktop would not ignite. The repair man proceeded to break the cook top and admitted that he caused the problem. He even said he would see if they had a comparable cook top to replace it with. A&R  instead paid for new parts to repair the cooktop. When the job was complete none of the burners worked. \n\nThe house sold and the stove did not pass inspection. Finally tired of the original making things worse I called for a supervisor. On July 17th a senior person came to the house and told my husband he didn't even need to go through the story of what happened because he had the weeks of paperwork. Once again it was explained that the final inspection coming up. All I needed was a working cooktop.\n\nI would call and yes I was frustrated answering the same questions and never getting the senior person on the phone again. The receptionists would always start the conversation asking how I knew the repairman broke the cooktop. Read the files so you know what was done every time he was in the house. And yes, I was angry. No one took responsibility for anything.\n\nA&R could not promise the cooktop would be in working condition before the final inspection. I threatened to take them to Small Claims Court more than once. With one week until the final inspection I was livid. Not cursing, just livid and certainly frustrated. I didn't get to talk to the supervisor, of course,  but was given his message. He said they would cancel the parts and I should take them to court. So I went out and bought a new cooktop so I could pass the inspection. \n\nA&R was totally incompetent in dealing with a situation they created. When it started I was a valued customer but since I would no longer require their services they decided they could treat me horribly. Remember this even if you are now a valued customer."
"2","So impressed with Petiamo service, prices, their salon set up and location.  My little critters were dolled up, smelled great (and not overly perfumed, which I appreciated), and they were HAPPY.  Our former groomer wasn't available,  so I found this place on Yelp, of course.  Mentioned at booking that I had to be at airport in early afternoon-- Leonard found me a morning slot and my dogs were done in record time!  Not saying that will always be the case, but sure am grateful for their consideration today.  Love this place!"
"1","Everything about Aureole shouted 'Stale'.   Like they're not even trying anymore.  They didn't even have the Cirque de Soliel style wine server working the cage. \n\nWe had the tasting menu, which is served in a cool way with a split plate with 2 dishes per round served in a different way.  Problem is after 5 courses I'd only say 1-2 were great and many were bland or just outright not good.\n\nGreat sommelier but the rest of the service was atrocious considering we had the biggest table (8+) in the place.   They are heaving on the foams, gelees, and technique but didn't deliver on flavor.\n\nKeep moving, nothing to see here."
"2","We came here friday morning for crepes to celebrate my daughters birthday. We got the nutella/strawberry crepe, and the ricotta/citrus/berry jam crepe, they were delicious, large and had plenty of filling. My daughter wanted a caramel macchiato, and the lovely young woman who took our order suggested the caramel latte, since their macchiato was different than what starbucks has, so we ordered both. The latte was good and the macchiato looked good, in a tiny espresso cup, yet I didnt like its flavor so woulnt order again. Since it was her birthday, my daughters drink was free, and she loved the writing on the cup, which was just the drinks name, but very artistic.Great way to start her birthday! (they also had some delicious looking pastries!)"
"2","Love it.\n\nI wish Potbelly would expand to my neck of the woods.  I love everything about them.  Fast and delicious sandwiches, lots of drink options, and yummy cookies.  I'm partial to a variation on the meatball sandwich (though their signature sandwiches are very tasty and far more original) and sugar-cane-cola.  Subway and Quizno's should tremble at the mere notion that Potbelly could invade the coasts.  If they brought their army of friendly and capable staffers with them, they could easily take over around here."
"2","Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas, NV was a perfect match for my recent Vegas vacation! It was was located on the Vegas Strip, within walking distance to great attractions like the Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas sign and many other great hotel/casinos. It was close to the tram access and only a short ride from McCarren Airport. The hotels amenities included numerous great restaurants (2 by Hubert Keller), clubs (Mix Lounge has THE best view of the strip), tons of pools to lounge by and even a shark reef! As for its affordability, it was a steal. I booked through southwest.com (thanks DrivenJess & DrivenTia for stalking their website). The package included airfare, hotel stay and tickets to a Cirque Du Soleil show for what I would have planned to spend just on the hotel. Split that three ways thanks to roomies and I had a little bit left over to try my luck at the tables. Tripadvisor.com gave the hotel 4 out of 5 stars and was helpful on figuring out which restaurants to try and what attractions just weren't worth the time. The room had a great view from 32 stories up and even helped us plan our walking trip to the In & Out Burger located just off the strip. Comfy beds, a big tub and the oh so lavish telephone in the john made me fell like I was in the prince's suite but only paying the price of a pauper."
"2","Oreo Frozen Hot Chocolate is great! Get 3 of them!"
"1","Quick background: Asian guy who loves sushi in Phoenix for the Dodgers Spring Training. \n\nI was weary of venturing into Giants' territory (Scottsdale) for sushi of all things. But upon yelping the entire city for a half decent Japanese restaurant... our group was directed to Dozo. Big mistake in trusting the \""star-rating\"" over the actual reviews; will explain.\n\nFirst impression:::::\nWe walk into Dozo which is located a few blocks from the Giants' Spring Training facility and inside of a plaza with a TJ Maxx. The restaurant was dark and about 75% of the tables were occupied. Good so far. We get seated right away. No Giants' fans to be spotted, even better.\n\nMenu::::::\n Nothing out of the ordinary. You got your rolls found in every Japanese restaurant; your California Rolls, your Spider rolls, nigari etc. etc. They also have bento boxes @ $11 and up. \n\n:::::::::We ordered 3 specialty rolls and 3 orders of Nigiri to start off almost as soon as we were handed the menu. You would assume placing your order means that you get your food shortly right? Nope. Begin the clock. With nothing to do besides talk and drink the water we were given. Minutes fly by and before I knew it, it was already 40 minutes after our order and a group of 10 Giants fans walk in. As I curse quietly to myself I log onto my Yelp app to actually read reviews about the place. At this point it is more than 45 minutes after we ordered and I stumble upon Jamie M.'s review where she mentioned that it took the the staff over 35 minutes for them to inform her that something she ordered was unavailable. As I read it to my group we are FINALLY served after 50 minutes. \n\nFood:::::\nSpider roll: Made of 6 average sized pieces of sushi (costed $12.50 btw). The fried soft shell crab was missing a key ingredient... the soft shell crab. Also this roll was poorly rolled... by that I mean just using my chop sticks to even attempt to place it in my mouth was a chore. The rice was not even sticking to the sushi \""filling\"" and was breaking apart before I even got to chew it. I was too hungry to really complain I just ate 2 pieces and onto the next.\n\nSalmon/Albacore Nigiri: Each piece was about 2\""x1\"" inches and the fish was wafer thin. Not worth it.\n\nFour Seasons Roll: Another $12 roll. The roll was so unmemorable I don't even recall what was in it.  Would I again pay $12 for this? You probably already know the answer.\n\nRed Dragon Roll: ..... I would review this if we actually got to eat it. Back to Jamie M's review. It is now 55 minutes after we ordered. And after indiscriminately devouring what we were finally served... the waitress trouts out and says basically, \""Oh hey, remember that Red Dragon Roll? We don't have any more soft shell crab. Would you like to get the Eel instead?\""  I have no ill feelings towards her but we were pretty pissed off. You know when you hear of someone's bad experience that you hope it doesn't happen to you as well? Yup, happened to us.\n\n::: Back to those pesky Giants' fans. I watched them get their drinks about half an hour and their edamame about 40 minutes after ordering. In fact, as they smugly smiled at us walking out they STILL did not get any actual food yet.  It's already been a few days and I bet they're still sitting around.  Now under any normal circumstances, I would not feel bad for a Giants' fan, but this might have been the one time...... NOT. \n\nObservations:::::::::::::::\n\n1) After we ordered I looked around at all the other tables. Of the 5 tables in our area, only ONE table had food. \n\n2) The majority of the positive reviews for Dozo are from a really long time ago and/or are not even relevant to food or the service(re: Jon P's \""review\""). I can only assume that the quality of food and service has taken a steep decline in the past few years.\n\n3) The sushi \""chef\"" could be heard running his mouth throughout the entire restaurant. I guess he forgot that he's supposed to actually do his job and I don't know... feed the customers who walk into the establishment? \n\n4) When you hear that this place is the \""best\"" sushi in all of PHOENIX, you should be wary of the reviews.\n\nConclusion::::::::\nIf you are a Giants' fan, this restaurant is perfect for you and you should definitely give them your business. Just kidding. This place is terrible and the only thing I enjoyed here was the water. No really. It didn't even taste like tap water. If you're from out of town, you would be better suited to get another kind of cuisine. If you're a local, definitely don't come here for sushi. There's got to be somewhere better than this."
"2","This is my new favorite restaurant in Phoenix. I went there on Saturday with my boyfriend and two other friends of ours for lunch. We arrived around 12:30 and the place was already busy and had a 20-30 minute wait. We decided to sit at the bar and grab a drink while we waited for our table. I couldn't believe their pitchers of beer were only $5 and they had my favorite, Hoegaarden. \n\nWhen our table was ready the server came over promptly and grabbed us two more pitchers of beer. We started out with the bruschetta however we let the server choose what bruschetta we would be eating that day. If you know me then you know that I'm a snobby/picky eater but I was blown away with the Roasted Peppers and Goat Cheese bruschetta. I would have never tried goat cheese but I'm glad that I did. It was so creamy and flavorful. Also on the plate were: Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone, Albacore Tuna with Gaeta Olives, Brie & Apples with Fig Spread. We gulped down the last of our pitcher, ordered around round and had another round of their delicious bruschetta. This time the server brought us: Smoked Salmon with Pesto, Tomato Jam & Fresh Sheeps Milk Cheese (I'm begging you to try this one), Salami with Pesto and Ricotta with Dates & Pistachios. They were all so mouth watering that I highly recommend all of them. \n\nAt the end of our lunch the server brought over a complimentary desert for us, a salted caramel sundae: vanilla bean ice cream with chocolate covered corn nut's, a pretzel stick and salted caramel. By far the best dessert I've ever had in my life. \n\nPostino's left such an impression on my boyfriend and I that we ordered takeout the next evening. We both decided on the Turkey Panini with a side of salad and the organic chips. They make their own lemon honey dijon salad dressing which tastes great on everything. \n\nI will definitely be a repeat customer at Postino's and I am demanding you to try it out this week/weekend. I promise you will not be disappointed."
"2","Went for weekday lunch on a Friday and there was a small wait so we opted for the communal tables. Slight snafu when our waitress didn't realize our party was three and not the five that all sat down around the same time, and she started taking someone else's order with ours, but it was easily sorted out. The communal tables are a bit too wide across so you have to speak up to talk across them, but I'd sit there again. \n\nOverall I was impressed with the look and feel of the place - there's a very \""natural\"" vibe carried through the decor and open air/sunlight that enhances the food. \n\nThe food was on the pricey side but the quality was apparent. To drink we all got the honey lemonade which was so simple but really excellent and comes with a free refill. I'd go back just for that! My companions enjoyed their open-faced salmon and the shaved turkey pita which each came with a side of mixed kale/sweet potato hash. I had the chicken panang curry which was tasty with fresh ingredients and well cooked, but I agree with the other reviewer that the ratio of sauce to rice seems off and too soupy. \n\nMy companions had tried the salads on previous visits and thought they were much too small for the money. For the price, I thought we got our money's worth."
"2","This place is amazing!! The service is fantastic and the prices are very reasonable for all that you get!!  I recently moved to Las Vegas and I had never had Thai food before but I am so glad I checked this place out!!  The Tofu soup and the all the garlic dishes are really good!!  My daughter had the garlic chicken and I have tried both the garlic beef and pork.   I have also tried one of the noodle dishes which was out of this world!   I was so pleased w/this place I recently brought my son and daughter in law when they came to visit and they enjoyed as well and Thanked us for treating them to such a great meal!!   We especially love the fact the food can be made as spicy or not as you like!!   I only wish I could rate this place 10 stars because it really was that great experience and we will continue to frequent this restaurant!!  :)"
"1","If this is how Chef Simon had worked on Iron Chef, Cat Cora would have kicked his ass!  The food came out 45 minutes after order (\""30 Minute Lunch\"" - BS!).  The food was overcooked and the waiter did not come back to ask us anything after it was served (he came by at the end to give us the check).  Had to ask for most things twice (sugar for tea, mustard, straws).  Does the Chef not care that he has such crappy service??!  There are so many other places to eat in Vegas, one would think that Simon does not want to be one of the crappy places (wait, too late..)."
"1","Ate there for the first and last time.  Let me start by saying the food was pretty good. \n\nThe price we paid for our meal was quite high for what we had and the serving sizes are small. The wait to order was ridiculous. It seemed to take us forever to get through the line. We were told to find a table and they would bring our drinks over to us. After almost 12 minutes my husband went to the front to find out when we we getting our drinks and were told to go to the bar and get them.  NICE!!!  Finally got the food but no one ever checked on us to see if we were satisfied with the food. \n\nIt was extremely noisy in there but there is very little to break up the noise. Like eating in a warehouse.  Sorry but no repeat business from us."
"2","Big fan of Mesa Grill, especially for lunch. \n\nTheir menu is very reasonably priced for a fancy casino restaurant and although their menu isn't extremely extensive, they have quite a few dishes to choose from. On this occasion, I shared a Mesa Burger and a Swordfish club with fellow Yelper. The burger was extremely moist and delicious. This was lunch date's favorite dish. The sandwich was really good. Filled with tons of avocado, bacon and swordfish between two (slightly too thick) slices of bread. The french fries were perfectly seasoned.\n\nWe finished our meal with a slice of coconut cake and the mango rum upside down cake. Both were fantastic as well.\n\nService was great. Our glasses never went unfilled and the waitstaff was extremely attentive. I highly recommend this place."
"2","First thing you need to do IF you decide to go by this place. Call and put in the order or you will be waiting in line drooling for 15-30 minutes.\n\nMy GF and I order 1/2 of poulet combo. It came with Fries and Salad. The bill was around 10 bucks or so. \n\nThe bird was bar b q really well. They give you a big portion. We try not to order big meal because we want to go to as many places as we can when we were in MTL. We were in Montreal for 3 days we ate here twice and it was well worth it.\n\nRemember look up the # and call first before you go. Check out the menu online. Or take a bib with you. :-)"
"2","Pretty good service, but really busy and noisy!! It gets a little overwhelming because the sales people are very knowledgeable and bombard you with useless techy information to I guess impress you?? Anyways I bought the Ipad 3 and it is freaking awesome and makes up for the store. I would give the Ipad 3 a gazillion stars if I could. I left it at home today and got really sad when I was driving away. Boo Hoo!!"
"1","To yelpers, feel free to look at many many of the other very negative reviews.  It's no coincidence.  Absolute worst restaurant experience ever.  Please see previous review as manager is now trying to fool yelpers.  If I was given $100 comp, I'd burn it.  I was merely trying make management aware of some common sense business etiquette.  watch out!  Beware!! Keep away!!  Why go here when there are so many much better rated options so nearby?!!  #dontfallforit #kitchennightmares #restaurantimpossible"
"2","Food is always good. We have never been disappointed when coming here. It's a little pricey, but the portions are always a good size as well. Especially lunch. Like most reviews the service does lack everytime we are here, but the food makes up for it."
"2","great place! i love the breakfast nacho here very very unique but definitely very popular. they are also pet friendly so i bring my olde english bulldogges with me."
"2","Food is awesome !!! Highly recommend it. Took a friend for his birthday and he loved it."
"1","Having returned from a BBQ binge in Kansas City a few months ago, we decided we'd get ribs in celebration of the Royals making the playoffs. Then winning the pennant. And then again for Game 7 of the World Series. So we've had Smoky Jon's ribs and pork shoulder three times in three weeks.\n\nHere's what's excellent: The pork shoulder and the sauce are fantastic. Right up there with the best there is. Just yummy.\n\nHere's what's not: Extremely inconsistent ribs. (I completely agree with another reviewer regarding the membrane... it really ought to be removed, every time.Not doing so is laziness by the pitmaster.)\n\nFor us, Batch #1 was pretty good -- not KC level, but totally fine. Batch #2 really was KC level... just excellent--tender, juicy ribs, clean bones, very nice. Food heaven. Batch #3 was terrible -- dry meat, thick membrane, difficult to even cut into 3-rib chunks. There's no way what we received could have ever won an award from anyone.\n\nSo after spending about $165 here in the last three weeks, I can't recommend it. Hey, ribs ain't cheap (and that's fine), but it's hard to justify if the quality isn't even close. I realize there will always be slight variations...that's what makes BBQ great. But the incredible inconsistency here kills it for me."
"1","DIDN'T EAT HERE...this review not about the food.  We went on Friday night around 8pm, there seemed to be about 25% occupancy.  The hostess asked us if we had a reservation, we didn't , and she told us that they were somewhat behind and that we would have to wait 20-30 minutes.  WTF?  We IMMEDIATELY left and frankly its not worth going back again.  shame, the fish was good there. Crappy hostess for sure."
"1","Wouldn't go back. It's a cool spot and all but it was too expensive for a dive bar. Maybe it was for the show but it felt overpriced for what the spot really is. Bartender was nice, got carded twice since they don't have security checking who comes into the place."
"1","Habit Burger. A HABIT I DO NOT WANT.\n\nTonight after shopping up a storm with the Mrs. (buying up Scottsdale for christmas), we were famished, ravenous, hungry, starving, and running on empty. We thought... \""Let's try that new burger place\""! \n\nSo after the umteenth jewelry store, it was late, real late, we jumped into the family truckster and gunned it over to Cactus before it blue-hairs could cut us off once again in their mad dash of the xmas frenzy we've battled all day. Pulling into a welcoming empty lot and slid into Habit Burger. It was new, clean, and looked appealing. I was excited. \n\nI ordered the Tri-Tip Sandwich with BBQ sauce (that I had to walk back up to get later). Sweet Potato Fries and a Chocolate Shake, No Whip (for that's how I roll) and the Mrs went for the Grilled Chicken Salad.\n\nI ate what I could, except for the big ol grizzly piece of hard sinew that was found in my sandwich. I took it up to the counter to let them know and do I get a 'Sorry', or \""what can we do to make it better' ...hell NO. The counter persons just says... \""OK\"". What, did I hear you right?!? \""OKAY\"" that's it? well fine, I go to leave and as I turn at the door just in time to witness the counter girl showing the piece I left with her to her store manager and they both give me an evil look as I exit.\n\nOKAY? NO, IT's NOT OKAY. I want someone just to say 'we're sorry.' They obviously are not. You just lost a customer for life, and I'll make it a HABIT never to return.\n\nEek! Methinks not. I wish you luck with serving sub-level product to the masses."
"1","Farnworth is a HORRIBLE management company. I finally moved largely to get out from under them. They wouldn't plant grass in front of the house I was renting or fix the gate or a ton of other things, and whenever the city fined them for violations, they'd turn around and fine me for it. I was usually able to avoid the fines (since they were illegal and out of the lease), but it always meant writing legal-style letters back and forth, visiting the tenant advocates office in Phoenix, etc. etc. So it was a tremendous waste of my time, and they were beyond rude every time I contacted them.\n\nAnd then, when it was finally time to move, I deep-cleaned the apartment to a ridiculous extent. I had ex-military guys helping me, and we cleaned it to beyond military standards. And Farnsworth still kept my security deposit, supposedly because I hadn't landscaped the back yard, even though it was clearly in the lease and in tenant law that it wasn't my responsibility. I tried to sue them to return my deposit but their lawyers somehow got the case dismissed and I haven't had time to start the process again. But the point is, STAY AWAY FROM FARNSWORTH AT ALL COST! You don't need the aggravation."
"2","This is the Starbucks that is inside the Target on Sky Pointe Drive. It's a very small Starbucks, even by in-store standards; however seems to have a fair selection of snacks, mugs and accompanying Starbo swag. \nI'm embarrassed to admit that I used to avoid the Target this Starbucks is in, specifically for their lack of caffeinated franchise-y goodness. But now Starbucks is here, as well as a newly opened grocery department, and there can be much rejoicing!\nThey frequently have just one employee working at this location and there's definitely a wait sometimes. I also think there might be some supply issues to work out as they were out of lemonade last week, which I rarely come across at other locations. BUT the barista who was working was super friendly and recommended I try strawberry juice (who knew they had that!!?) in the place of lemonade in my passion tea. She then made samples for myself and other patrons to try. Oh yum!!! It might be my new favorite summer treat. Starbucks- you rule, as usual!"
"1","The meal came with samosas which were not on the menu, but really, really tasty.  You get one with each meal as well as a small salad. \n\nThe samosa was the best part of the meal by far. The meal size is nice for the amount you pay and very reasonable (not a lot, but not nothing either).  But the food is just incredibly bland.  Making something spicy-hot won't cover the fact that the spice blends that should be there just aren't (or if they are, they just don't pop).\n\nWe got delivery and we won't eat from here again."
"2","I was in this place this morning and had to write a review despite not going very often because I was so pleased with my experience. I only go about every 6 months because its next to my dentists office so therefor its reasonable they have new management or staff every few times. \n\nThis time i'm pretty sure the entire staff was new, it was very busy for breakfast but quickly died down because they had a really nice system going where they were able to take orders and prepare them in a timely fashion.\n\nHowever I was especially pleased with the graciousness of all the employees, every one I encountered from the man who took my order to the lady who prepared my food and the man who rang me out was very friendly. All of them asked how I was doing and wished me a Happy Thanksgiving. Its that small amount of human interaction with genuine people that make for a great establishment. \n\nLastly as always my food was great, the bagels never disappoint."
"1","I have always gone to Ulta salon to get my hair cut. I will never go there again! I had made an appointment to get my hair cut a couple of weeks ago. I went into the place and said why I was there. The  lady at the receptionist desks tells me \"" the hairstylist could not make it  and could we change my appointment for either a later time or date.\"" I said, \"" well I would really like to get it done today.\"" I had other plans the following days, so the only other day I could do it would be Monday. I then said \""there is no way you can fit me in now.\"" She flat out said \""no\"" when I walked  in she was just standing there lookng on the computer, not really doing anything. Needless to say I was livid. I had never been trerated that way at a place of business. I walked of and put my hand in the air to wave her off and said \""ok, cancel it!\"" I know other people heard me because their heads turned. \n\nI did how ever go to Super Cutts in the same shopping center and got my hair cut by their manager who was wonderful and met every ounce of my needs plus, I saved ten dollars. \n\n\nLesson learned, sometimes the higher style salons are not what they are  cracked up to be."
"1","Well here again not much has changed. Brisket is really fatty, 4 out of the 5 ribs are good. Last one was all gristle. Salad was rubbery and the side where ok. \n\nOh well"
"2","I was visiting my house here in Surprise this week from Washington, DC.  Found this place on Yelp, and I am very impressed with the service and especially the pizza.  I have been looking for a great place to go that was near my house and this is the place."
"2","No complaints for a vegas buffet. We were lucky and got a line pass so got to have less wait in the buffet line. After coming in, saw some nice options: Host of seafood including huge king crab legs, endless amounts of salad. the only one down-side was the peking duck was really old and tough. We ended up not eating any of that. also liked the prime rib. They also offered kobe beef as well. I am a big fan of the dessert section for this buffet. Dessert comprised of eating as many macaroons as they placed out. It was the Vanilla Macaroon and I couldn't help but go back for seconds. It was off the hook! Wish they had gelato like the Wicked spoon, but the bellagio buffet will always remain one of my fave Vegas buffets."
"2","I have to tell you that I love this gym.  I mean, as much as you CAN love a gym.\n\nThe folks are nice, it's a diverse scene -- from Camelback soccer moms, to the nursing home set to the gay guys who are so cut that they intimidate me.  And there are your standard muscle heads and women who just want to be seen.  Overall though it's great.\n\nThe gym is always clean.  It's modern, well lit and offers a wide variety of equipment. \n\nThe only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because the cardio machines can get really busy during peak times -- 7 -- 8 a.m. and 5:30 - 6:30 p.m.  Sometimes you actually have to wait to hop on a machine.  That's a bummer when you'd rather be at home watching TV or maybe doing something productive."
"2","Simply amazing. We tried the Whole Grain salad - fresh and flavorful. Loved the lemon-chile vinaigrette. Chef Stephen even came by our table to answer questions about the dish.  Also the tables outside provide a very pleasant dining environment to enjoy Chef Stephen's yummy creations before you tour the Desert Botanical Garden."
"1","Slow and with a service that leaves lots to desire.  Food is not that good either.  My fork was dirty enough to look like it hadn't been washed at all and my wife's french toasts actually tasted like sausage (maybe using the same pans for everything?)\n\nOverall, just a \""meh\"" (or even \""below meh\"") restaurant."
"1","Worst groomers in town! Butcher my dogs and didn't even tell my family about the different packages. Horrible service and made my dogs sick while there"
"2","I tried this place for the first time today and I will definitely go back. The location is very convenient for me, it's a good value, and they started working on him as soon as I handed over the leash. For $25 (my dog is only 15 pounds so it may be more for larger dogs) they gave him a bath and brush, nail trim, and expressed his anal glands. The fact that the glands are a standard part of the service is what sold me. It's what I needed for my dog the most and I have never had to take him before so I was happy to see that it would be no extra cost and no extra hassle for them. I like that they don't put the dogs in cages so my dog got to play with the other dogs there until I came to get him. I'm happy I found this place and will recommend it to others."
"2","I cant say enough about this place. I love the simple yet elegant food. Prices are ok. Wine is fantastic! Excellent atmosphere. Helpful wait staff. And yes, the butternut squash soup is to die for! Only regret is that I wished they toasted their bruschetta bread. Too soggy."
"1","Not going back.\n\nI used to go here all the time... when I started going here about 2 years ago, the place was great.  Not conservative with drinks and the food was pretty tasty.  The waiters were nice and friendly.\n\nCame here last nght with a large party of friends and I was not pleased and that opinion was shared by everybody at my table.\n\nWe were crammed in their largest booth... not a problem.  \n\nBut it is a problem when someone has to leave for a minute and so you don't want to make everybody move again, so you come back and sit on the end right?  \n\nWaiter didn't like that and had the cojones to ask us to not move seats.\n\nI understand that it's inconvenient for the waiter as far as the check out goes, but I'm sorry, it's not about them.  If you're paying my bill, you can call the shots on where I sit in my booth.  But since you're not, we will figure out who gets what bill especially when all of us have our own separate checks anyway.  We know who got what and we'll help the waiter figure it out because we aren't total assholes... so don't ask us to not move seats when we aren't in chairs.\n\nI had the california shrimp salad... used to be better.  The dressing wasn't that great, a couple tomatos in it weren't as fresh as I felt they should be.\n\nBut the kicker... after nobody had had no more than 2 beers and it was clear we had DD's (I was one of them), we were told that they were cutting us off.  Yes, we are loud and have fun and laugh, but isn't that what you're supposed to do???  \n\nApparently that's not ok with this Applebees.\n\nBad enough, those of us that were drinking something other than alcoholic didn't get any refills of what we were drinking... \n\nI'm not going back.  It has just gotten worse and worse there and so they might as well just shut down their bar and make it a family restaurant if they want people to quietly sit and eat their food and not complain about poor service."
"2","compared to other buffets like aria which is less in price but wicked spoon the decor is amazing - large selections of food lots of meats , sausage - omelette station - fried stuff - gelato!! pasteries desserts yumm =P"
"2","This is a brand new music venue in Downtown Phoenix. It's very well done, with a nice ambiance and a section of the room set aside as a stage. Everyone who works there is terrific and very helpful, nice, etc.  The room is simple, the acoustics are well done, and the restrooms and such are clean.  But, that's it. There isn't a patio or really any food (except the costco type snacks for 1.00, etc.), beverage service, etc.  \n\nI would have given it a 3 star, but the venue is so promising I want others to visit it. The BEST music is here, and it will only get better!"
"1","Decor & Presentation: 4 STARS\n\nFRIENDLY AND KNOWLEDGEABLE CUSTOMER SERVICE: 3 stars\n\nTASTE of cupcakes: 1 STAR\n\n(0 stars if I could! why force yourself to eat a cupcake when it taste like it was bought from the GROCERY STORE?)\n\nStay away from this place! Don't let the pretty exterior of this store fool you!\n\nUghh...I AM NOT a big fan of  GROCERY STORE BOUGHT CUPCAKES and that's EXACTLY THE WAY THEY TASTE! If you like DRY cupcakes and HARD, OVERLY SWEET frosting, then you'll like this place. However if you can appreciate QUALITY, texture and taste then STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE! If you're looking for a moist cupcake and soft creamy frosting that will just melt in your mouth, this is definitely NOT a place you want to try out because I've already given you the scoop.\n\nI've tried many many cupcake places so I think I know a thing or two about what good qualities go into a kick-ass cupcake and this place was just a huge disappointment. You would think from how wonderful the store is set up that the cupcakes would reflect some goodness...but NO! The cupcakes are just awful :( So awful, I COULDN'T EVEN FINISH ONE CUPCAKE of the box of four my mother had bought me for my birthday. I picked out all the flavors but I didn't like any. I felt so bad I had to throw them in the trash. I took two bites of each cupcake, FORCED myself on the second bite just to see if it would get any better, but it just tasted worse!\n\nAt first I thought it was just one cupcake that was bad, but then I tried the other 3 and they were ALL just: \n     Toooo dry, \n     Possibly too much refined sugar, \n     Too much artificial ingredients,\n     Did NOT have that good old HOME BAKED taste, \n     Tasted like a larger version of cupcakes from the GROCERY store! \n\nStale, hard, OVERLY SWEET frosting and dry cake. All things I definitely don't yearn for when biting into a cupcake. Maybe their cupcakes stay out in that case too long? I don't know but even the formula of the recipe needs to be tweaked or something. Cake is bad, frosting's bad. The nuts and decorations that dressed it up tasted better than the actual cake. Also, what's up with the excessive amount of frosting on top of the cake? Almost piled higher than the cake itself! They seriously put unnecessary large amount of frosting that ended up being tossed in the trash anyway, along with the dry cupcake!\n\nHonestly, we could have used the money spent here for gambling money! There's soooo many other decadent places worth visiting than this one, save yourself the trip!"
"1","I am a local and went to Buddy V's for the first time. I was very unimpressed with the overall meal. The service was incredibly poor. Once we sat down and got water, it took a very long time for anyone to come over and even see if we were ready to order or had questions. Our appetizers came out and were very bland and the garlic bread was burnt. No one came by to see if everything was ok, so by the time someone did come over, our next course was out. They got us a new garlic bread, which also came out burnt. They did end up taking it off our bill. Our other food was just ok. Kind of bland and uninteresting, and definitely not worth $22! Overall I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone and I will not be back."
"1","Was not a fan. For the prices I wanted to be wowed but it was only eh. Servers tried too hard (we ended up with 3 servers some how). Sorry but won't be back"
"1","Do not go to this place for business. One they tried selling me 4 tires that were not my size said it was okay it won't hurt my car. I spoke to the dealer and 5 others who said never buy tires that don't fit your car. They also sold me one good tire knowing I was riding around on 3 bald tires. When I told someone about it because I didn't know any better, they told me to call them and take my tire back. As professionals any tire place know not to change one tire you change two or a set because it is ruining your alignment Never ever use them. When I told the guy what he did his response was \""well I don't care I gave you what you asked for, I did not have to tell you that\"" No morals whatsoever funny but they tried getting me to buy a set of tires too small for my car. Disgusting. Stay away go to someone else reputable"
"2","This is a great bar.  I love the fact that you sit in an open circle providing ample opportunity to people watch the high end shoppers.  Good service and great selection of whiskey, bourbon, gin, and other yummy distilled treats."
"1","Pros: Broad menu selection. Cons: Unrealistic beer prices... at least, for Guinness. At $6.50 per (imperial) pint, it's the most expensive Guinness in Charlotte."
"1","I had the special at the servers suggestion.  It was a chicken with stuffing, mashed potatoes, and fresh vegetables.  The veggies were not fresh, the patatoes were undercooked and the chicken dry."
"1","My boyfriend and I have gone to this place several times and really enjoy sitting at the sushi bar.  The food is consistently good. The reason for the 2 stars is the poor customer service. We normally order one saki bomber.  The menu says $6.50 but when you order, the server offers a large beer without mentioning this \""penny\"" beer special so then we are charged 11.50 for the 6.50 menu bomber.   We talked to the server twice and nothing was done. If you are going to run a great beer special then offer it to your customers.  There are a couple of other sushi restaurants in the area that offer better food along with good customer service and who promote their specials.  Not going back to this place again."
"1","Walked in today to browse around, then se something interesting. A laser printer for $50. Looking around there were no associates to help. Walked to one if the registers to ask for assistance and was told the asst mgr would help me as soon as he finished bringing up the furniture. So while waiting for him, I browsed more selections. And after about 5 mins he showed up, asked if I still required help and then stated if I can hold on for a couple more minutes so he could get me a specialist. That threw me for a spin a bit. U would think the asst mgr could help me a bit before just sending me back out to wait. I can see that customer service is not a priority in this establishment. If it was, you would think that I would be assisted somewhat while waiting for the so called specialist. Unfortunately he just walked away. \n\n20 mins later and still no one, the asst mgr came back up to me as I finally walked up to me and asked if I was helped. Nope, no one helped me, not even you. He apologized and then stated sorry, maybe next time. Really, next time, are you serious. Why even bother, if no one knows what's happening in the store, especially the asst mgr."
"1","We have been to the Beef and Bottle several times in the past and always had a good experience.  The food has always been good and the service as well.  Unfortunately, I recently had a very unsettling phone conversation with the manager as I was trying to set up a reservation.  4 couples bought a Living Social with the hopes of having a nice dinner together.  It says in the fine print of the coupon that you can only use one per table.  I was hoping that we might be granted an exception, especially when I explained that it would be the same for them either way - we would come and sit at 4 separate tables and use 4 vouchers OR they could just let us sit together.  Alas, no exception and a very rude manager as I tried to explain how they were not going to be out any more money.  Oh well . . . . . . One of our favorites just became NOT one of our favorites . . . . . . It's not so much that I didn't get the answer I wanted, it was the way I was treated on the phone - definitely not professional and quite rude."
"1","ZERO STARS FOR CHIPOTLE!!!! know I said that I wouldn't come back to this location but I SOMEHOW got talked into coming again. Guess what?! They \""ran out\"" of guacamole, again! After I asked if they were going to make more and one of the girls said \""It takes too long to make and we ran out of avocados\"". -.- I looked into their kitchen and want to know what I saw? A huge bowl of avocados!! Really? You're really going to lie to my face. Two minutes later I walked over to get lemons and they \""ran out\"" of those too. You need to pay attention to detail!!"
"1","It started off with a more-than-20-minute wait even though we had a reservation. After we finally got seated at the \""tapas and wine bar,\"" we waited for the waiter to come to the table. Finally he came, but he knew nothing about wine. We asked for a recommendation for a dry, minerally white wine, and after checking with someone else he brought us a sweet oaked chardonnay. Then there was the ceviche we ordered that didn't actually have avocado in it.. If you want generally mediocre food, consistently slow service, and waiters who don't know the wine or food, go to Ibiza. Otherwise, stay away."
"2","I was on vacation and I found this particular restaurant through Yelp and what a great find it was!  My wife and I had lasagna and then we got a pizza to go. Both items were absolutely delicious. We also tried the house dressing on our salads. It was a kind of thick creamy Italian dressing and it was excellent.\nIt's a small family run operation. The kind of place where you walk in and order at the counter and then have a seat. The place is very clean and well lit. It is located in a shopping center so there is plenty of parking. \nSo if you are looking for a good fairly priced Italian restaurant without any pretense check this one out. You won't be disappointed."
"2","Fresh made pasta in a cozy neighborhood strip mall. I wasn't expecting the quality of the food to be so good. It's a bistro atmosphere with friendly service. They have good lunch specials and the place is busy. Dinner, especially on a week night, was more quiet."
"2","Tulips have the best authentic Birani I've tasted in charlotte! The lamb sheik kebab is my personal favorite.. It's only downfall is the price as it's more expensive than other Indian restaurants in the university area."
"1","I just check my room and find out bed bugs on my bed I never coming back again here \nThe room looks clean but u never know how much time the spend to clean the room  first time here and my last time \nGoing to call the management"
"1","STAY AWAY!!!!!\n\nI recently spent a weekend at the montalucia resort and booked a spa day at joya. The men's sauna and locker room is a gay sex hotspot!! I was sitting in the hot tub when a guy walked up to be and asked for a blow job!! I left and went into the Sauna and he followed me in there and brought his phone out to watch porn and jack off!!! \n\nThis place is disgusting for your safety please stay away!!!!! \n\nI spoke with the employees at the spa and they could of cared less\n\nstay away from this disgusting place"
"1","Just got back from Vegas in which we stayed the last night at Aria, so thought we would hit their breakfast buffet, thinking it would be on par with Belligo and Wynn. Boy, were we wrong. OK, know it's only their second day in operation, but how can you screw up bacon and eggs? My wife and I were shown our table, and immediately went to get our food. The food area was quite long, but not a great selection. Usually I walk and look at the food and figure out the few things that look best so I can fit them onto my plate, but here, it was a struggle to find enough things appealing enough to eat. Their eggs benedict looked very weird; the eggs were freakishly white. Hard to find just regular breakfast fare. There were two omelet stations with many people waiting at each ( you know a buffet is bad when people opt for the 'ol standby omelet) I got in line behind Mr. Picky who had to have a special egg white only omelet with veeeery light Cheddar cheese and was also behind some punk kid who was eating off his plate in line. Idiot. The chef manning the station seemed overwhelmed by the special order so I moved on. A huge slice of ham (not bad), some Chinese egg concoction and a slice of pizza later I went back to eat. Started eating and no server yet. Half way through and still no server. Finally when I was almost done, a server asked if I wanted anything to drink. I barely chocked out, \""orange juice\"". Finally, when I was on my second to last bite, my drink came, all six ounces of it. I asked for two more. \nFor 15 bucks, this should have been much better. I have gotten just a good breakfast at Terribles for half the price. Also, since this place should be one of the elite, what I found totally tacky was at each of the foods, instead of having a nice plaque with what the food is, it was written on the sneeze windows with grease pencil. Totally lame. Not sure if we would go back to eat here even if comped. Perhaps their lunch and dinners are better."
"2","Delicious food, large portions. Its family owned and tastes like a happy Greek grandma made my food! The marinated chicken platter is my favorite- great spices and flavor. Clean bathrooms too! Love this place. Opa!"
"2","I've only ever been here for happy hour on a week day, so I can only comment on my experience at the bar. Even on a week day, there was a 30+ minute wait for a table, however, we were perfectly fine scoring two seats at the bar. We ordered drinks and were able to order some \""saucy balls\"" as an appetizer. \nThe vibe at the bar has a very luxurious feel, and the drink menu is extensive. Lots of after-work, happy hour people. I also only was able to stay at the bar on the bottom level, I did not venture to the upstairs. \nFor the happy hour crowd, I would say the bar was a little understaffed. I am not sure if there was an event going on that time, or if they are usually this busy on a week night, but they could have used at least one more person behind the bar.\nI thought the food was delicious and quick to come out.\nI also ordered the cheese and olive plate, which was perfect with my cab sauv.\nHighly recommend for after-work dinner or drinks!"
"2","You won't be disappointed.  No high pressure sales pitches, no contracts, just good, honest chiropractic care.  Always friendly, quick to accommodate and very affordable.  I just can't say enough good things about Dr. Hedrix and her staff."
"1","Extremely disappointed in this place. The one in Scottsdale is great. This location however not so much. \n\nGot a pan pizza and literally came out as bread and cheese. There was almost NO sauce on it and hardly any ingredients. It was cut into 4 giant slices, then everything fell off as I picked it up with a spatula! Not only that but on too of this, the pizza dough wasn't even cooked through all the way. Such a waste of money."
"2","If someone were to ask me about the best thing I've recently ate, I'd say it's Banzo's falafel. \nI didn't have them in pita. Just the balls a la carte.\nNow I get why people love this place. These super fluffy inside, crispy-outside falafel are the best that I've ever had anywhere. I thought I had sampled some of the finest falafel a from SF Bay Area to Paris, but I am happy to report that Banzo's falafel wins the title of \""the best.\"""
"2","COSTCO FOOD COURT IS THE BOMB!\n\nEvery time I shop here at Costco, more often then not, I end up eating at the food court. So of course I always end up looking to check in and nada, zip, zilch, nothing! So now for all of you that are reading this, HOORAY! You can check in now! Maybe it will get you some type of badge.\n\nAs everybody knows, the Costco Food Court has some of the best tasting food at prices that everybody loves! Let's see, you got your choice of either a Polish or All American Hot Dog that comes with a drink for $1.50! Can I get an AMEN! A Chicken Bake for $2.99, a Toasted Ciabatta Turkey Sandwich for $3.99, and some other items that catch your eye as well like a huge slice of either Cheese, Pepperoni, or Combination pizza for umm......damn I cant remember cuz I only order it for my kids.\n\nAnyways, you guys get what im saying. They have something for everybody and its not too hard on your wallet. I say the price you pay for the membership alone is worth it just for the food court!\n\nThe only downfall that irks me is that they only take cash. You would think that since you can pay with either debit or American Express at the front registers that these guys would have the same set up. NOT! Although you can pay for whatever you wanna get at the food court at the front registers is a little better, that still is kind of a hassle.\n\nIn the end, I have yet to have a bad experience with the service and food every time I eat here. Imagine a Costco thats 24 hours. Now THATS something to behold! It IS Vegas so you never know. In the meantime, I can always go for a hot dog or turkey sandwich."
"1","F*ck this place. Maybe the location in Tempe is better. First of all, just because I'm not dressed like a hippie/pothead doesn't mean I'm not one and shouldn't be treated differently. And just because you have dreds, tattoos, piercings and wear a bob marley shirt doesn't make you a true hippie. The help sucked major ass. They were all stuck up in their little hippie fantasy role thinking they are just so cool. I had my daughters with me and they were not kid friendly! We had to use the bathroom, there was no toilet paper. I had to ask and they bitched about that. \""Are you sure?\"" No, why would I make that up? Then I order the magic mushroom pinner. She asked me what I wanted on it and then didn't even listen to me, I had to keep repeating myself. When I took a bite, it was so salty I almost had a heart attack! She said teryaki sauce came with it. You don't have to drench it with sauce, whore! So I asked for my money back just on that sub, not the drinks and not the other sub. They had a fit! \""Well, we'll only refund you half  because you ate half of it!\"" I showed her I took two mfing bites!!! So, they reluctantly gave me $6 back. I tipped them $1 just to show I'm not the one that was the asshole. But as I drove away, I flipped them off hoping that they saw me. Remember my face, bitches!"
"2","My 3 1/2 year old had seen all the indoor play places around the Valley, and this place is near the top of his list.  It's clean, well maintained, the toys are in great shape, and there is a wide verity.  His top three is the Roller Coaster, Big Slide, and Thomas The Train ride.  As for my (the parent) perspective.  The price is right and it isn't a long drive from where I live in Surprise when you take the 303.  Overall when the temps hit triple digits and the little ones are climbing the walls, this place is a great prescription!"
"2","Kevin's solutions are straightforward, resourceful and often surprisingly inexpensive. He gave me a simple suggestion today for a laptop problem, and it worked. I know with Kevin that his aim is to offer his customers what they need .... whether that be a $5 used mouse or a new computer. My computer and my wallet are in good hands at Kevin's Computer and Photo."
"1","The staff here was very friendly and extremely nice.  However, I brought a ring in to be sized of which the jeweler in the back said he could do there.  When he was done I noticed the stone was now loose. I pointed it out and they said they couldn't fix it there they would have to send it to the main location.  I wanted to wear the ring so I kept it.  Then I realized a week later looking at the ring close up because the stone was loose, that the stone actually had a chip in it.  This was not there when I originally brought it in.  I was very upset.  Not only was the stone loose now in the ring, but there was a chip in the stone as well.  Not happy."
"1","Unfortunately, I wish I could not give any stars. I go to the Circle K on Miller & Camelback. Place looks fairly clean, but TERRIBLE customer service, the employees are always frowning and never look happy. They also have a habit of not welcoming you in the doorway nor do they say \""Have a nice day.\"" I have never seen them out on the floor doing anything, they just sit behind the counter moping and looking miserable. There is also a girl there who took my ID and would NOT stop asking how old I was! I was so irritated by her ignorance. Unfortunately it's the closest Circle K I can go to get things considering I have no vehicle. Seriously, get some new employees! I hate going there!!"
"1","When you walk through the door you're greeted with an amazing smell (reminded me of when my dad would cook meat in our smoker with apple wood chips when we were kids). Second was how great the restaurant looked, it was clean and inviting. The bartender smiled and waved at us like we were old friends and told us to have a seat anywhere...(time was 12:22)\n\nSo far we're off to a great start. So what possibly could have went wrong to cause a 2 star review? Our service. \n\nThe bartender brought us over some menus and explained that we could order brunch or lunch, brought us some chips and salsa, then went back to the bar, we didn't see any other server in the restaurant so for a while we thought she was just ignoring us. So we sat and sat and sat waiting for our actual server to come by. Keep in mind there were 3 other tables in the restaurant, one was just leaving so we'll call it two. \n\nLet's touch on the chips and salsa. I loved the chips, they were fantastic, however, the salsa was not a \""dipping salsa\"" it had a wonderful flavor and would have been great on a taco salad (why don't you have taco salads?) or poured on the top of a burrito but it was horrible for dipping chips. There were NO chunks, it was the consistency of hot sauce. \n\nFinally our server greeted us with her presence, she walked up and didn't say \""Hi, I'm so-and-so, I'll be taking care of you folks today\"" or \""Welcome to Lenero, have you been here before\"" or even just \""hello\"" instead she said \""what can I get you to drink\"". I almost responded with an \""hi, I'm fine thank you for asking\"" but I refrained. We ordered our drinks and I asked for an order of guacamole, it's 12:31 at this point (9 min after walking in the door). \n\nThere we sat, bored with our chips and salsa, read every yelp review of Lenero, discussed our plans for rest of the day etc. Our server finally came by to ask if we were ready to order. Not by asking if we were ready or if we had any questions. She walked up and in her snotty tone said \""what do you want\"". Seriously?? That's not how you talk to someone! I was so taken aback by her attitude I decided right then and there we will not be back. This food would have to be sent straight from the Heavens for it to tip the scales back in the favor of the restaurant. \n\nI ordered the chicken tacos and my bf ordered the enchiladas. As she was walking away he mentioned to her we're still waiting on our guac, it's been over 10 min at this point. She seemed surprised by our request to get the guacamole, almost like she just plain forgot I even ordered it. \n\nFinally our guacamole came. TWENTY-ONE minutes after ordering it. By this time the appeal of chips and guac was completely gone. She gave a million excuses about how there were steaks that needed to be cooked and the cook is extremely busy. The only other table in the place had already gotten their food and was about to leave. That left one table of folks. You're telling me the cook couldn't manage to toss some guacamole together because he was too busy making steaks for the one table in the restaurant? She told us it was on the house. That was nice but I would have rather of paid for it and have received it 16 min ago. \n\nFinally the bartender came over to apologize for the guacamole taking so long and explained that the cook is new and he went in order of the tickets arriving and needed to prepare the food for the OWNER'S FAMILY first. So I've been sitting here hungry because the owner needed to eat and that took priority? \n\nOur lunch came out pretty fast and my tacos were good, what the menu doesn't mention is they are street tacos, not normal sized ones. Which was fine by me but I could see where someone else wouldn't have been impressed with 4 really small tacos. The enchilada was also good but the menu should clarify it is a spicy dish. While we both love spice, again I can see how someone else would not have liked it. If my mom had ordered it she wouldn't have been able to eat it, the dish was that spicy. \n\nBottom line is we do not have any intentions on coming back. While the food was good, it wasn't phenomenal. The salsa was not ideal for \""chips and salsa\"" and the service was HORRIBLE. It's been a long time since I've had a server that snobby. She should be really lucky we left her 20% because she certainly did not deserve it (I'm having tipper's regret)."
"2","I only stayed one night... nonetheless, I'm a fan (foooooooor DAAAAAYZ!!)\n\nKimpton Hotels are customer service/experience oriented and they certainly treated me with the upmost care.\n\nThe walkability of this particular property is most advantageous.... 'AND' the amenities are FAABB..."
"2","Pizza in the CU seems to be an overall disappointment. We like Papa Del's, but it is pricey and takes forever to deliver, and although we like Jupiter's and Timpone's for a good thin crust, they are more involved than a simple good delivery or quick bite.\n\nStepping into that gap, my wife and I find Papa Murhpy's convenient and tasty. Their veggie delite is great. What I like about the pizza is that the toppings are good, particularly the ample fresh veggies. \n\nOne of their pizzas has a garlic sauce that we also like.\n\nMaybe it's just me, but these pizzas seem much less oily and overall slightly healthier than what we get when we order out, and of course in baking ourselves get second to none freshness.\n\nSo, we've had great experiences here and really enjoyed the flavors, and also feel that we've ate (slightly) healthier and saved some money. It also doesn't hurt that we're a mile away and we can grab one on a trip to Schnuck's."
"2","I am constantly on a quest for a great used book store.  I'd passed by this little place a few times, and one day I finally went inside.  The first moment I walked in the door, my senses flooded with the scent of old books (one of my favorite scents on the planet, strange as that is).  \n\nThey really have a pretty large selection of books, which was surprising given the size of the store.  They had a greatly blend of fiction and nonfiction.  I appreciate that they had it laid out in narrower categories than many used book stores I've been to in the past.\n\nJust one minor complaint so far.  Some categories of fiction novels were intertwined in shelves that I assumed at first glance were nonfiction.  It made it a little difficult to find some of the categories of fiction books.  \n\nI'll definitely be returning here in the foreseeable future."
"1","Look, I know what (not) to expect from what is actually a Motel 6. The rooms themselves are so-so for the price range, but the service is TERRIBLE.\n\nI booked my stay online, and it was a WASTE OF TIME. The first receptionist (albeit a sweetheart) was absolutely clueless that such a process even existed. Ignoring the small deposit, with the summary of the remaining balance listed in the online confirmation I had her read, she had no record of any reservation made. Despite being charged a small portion of the night's charges already, my remaining balance was ignored, and I was charged the full amount.\n\n\""You don't need to make reservations; we're pretty much NEVER full\"", she said. This is important.\n\nMy room was a bit lacking in basic bathroom supplies, so when I returned to the lobby late that night I was blown off by the second receptionist. \""We don't keep any of that here\"", she said sternly, moving on to the next task*. EVERY hotel and motel I have ever been to (read my reviews, I go to a lot) keeps items in or near the lobby. This is unacceptable, even for this chain.\n\nOh, and by \""next task\"", I mean telling two gentlemen there were no rooms available whatsoever, despite the fact there were still openings online and the previous staff member acknowledged the facility was no where near capacity. \n\nSo basically, there is complete ignorance of the online booking function, an absolute disregard for basic hospitality, and at worst, the unethical practice of straight up lying to potential customers to deny service. Never coming back."
"1","If you come here for a pre-employment hair drug test, DO NOT trust Michelle Garcia cutting your hair. I went in for the drug test & was unfortunate to get this MONSTER. I have long black hair. This witch cut off a huge chunk of hair from the top/crown part of my head, that started from the right to the left then went down to the back of my head. It wasn't even a clean cut. She swore she was making sure you wouldn't be able to see, but she's obviously a liar. Before cutting my hair she kept telling me how beautiful my hair was. I was so upset & I made sure she knew it. Her response was, \""I'm sorry honey.\"" Bitch are you serious?? I quickly shut her up. Don't tell me you're sorry when you intended to do this.  She didn't even bother cutting my hair from 3 different spots, instead she cut a ridiculously chunk of hair from 1 spot!"
"1","I'd give it a zero if I could. This place is weak as fuck. Mexican food? Please. I'd rather go to Taco Bell. There's a taco truck down the road that you're better off spending your money on."
"2","Another location of the already well-known frozen yoghurt shop in pittsburgh"
"1","Mediocre in every way.  Service and food.  Overreliance on salt in the remoulade was a disappointment from this name.  The whole place looked tired and past prime."
"1","Food was pretty average.  Waitress was pleasant.  I ordered the mixed grill.  It was all chicken.  Where was the mix that was on the menu?!?  $15.99 for grilled chicken and a few grilled onions is not a bargain.  No rice. Burnt naan.  I will return to Puran in Bloomington:)"
"1","Driver forgot the sauces and I waited over hour and a half for my delivery. I'm pretty sure he was on drugs cuzz he had blood shot eyes. ... I'm probably never ordering pizza from here ever again.."
"1","Was excited to try this place because it had great reviews. However, we were really unimpressed. First of all the waitresses argued over which one was actually going to wait on us, after we had already been waiting for quiet sometime. The waitress barely understood basic English. My husband ordered no beans with his meal and I got no beans with mine which I wanted. My husband said his chicken enchiladas tasted like chicken from a can. I wasn't impressed with my meal as well. We ordered fried ice cream for Desert and it wasn't good at all the ice cream was hard as a rock and couldn't even spoon it apart. Don't think we will be returning."
"2","Excellent plumbing service! Called late Saturday scheduled for Sunday. Called 30 minutes prior to appt as stated. Arrived on time and fixed my problem in fifteen minutes. The crappy Home Depot captured nut puller failed and I could not get the nuts off the copper pipes. His puller pulled them quickly and he installed the new valves and hoses while he was in there. 90 dollar base for a visit. Paid 90."
"2","Wow if the owners here knows how to serve the sushi properly when patrons are sitting in front of the sushi bar, this place would be astounding. First of all, let me set something straight.... Mizumi is situated inside the Wynn Hotel in Las Vegas and you'd expect the food to be pricy and.... IT IS! One thing I can say is that this place serves the FRESHEST FISH I EVER ATE IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. I've been to many great sushi restaurants in NYC but this places fish is top notch, GRADE A like how Colombians like their coke...if you know what im saying lol. \n\nGOOD:\nFreshest fish I've ever tasted.\nPieces are HUGE\n\nBAD:\nSushi rice is supposed to be in room temperature but its a bit cold. Flavor of rice could use a ITSY bit more of vinegar.\nNormally when you sit in front of a sushi bar, the chef serves each sushi piece by piece but not this place. \nAlso, the chef would brush the mixture of soy sauce onto your sushi prior to serving each piece but not this place....\n\nOverall, i'm giving it a 4 star is because of the quality of the fish and the huge portion that comes with it."
"1","I knew I shouldn't have stopped.  All my other visits over the years had been terrible but I was really craving fried shimp and couldn't imagine how they could screw it up.  Well...$8 later after eating 3 flavorless greasy shrimp and picking at the fish I threw it away because I knew I was going to throw up if I ate any more.  It was THAT bad.  Where is the corporate or owner quality control on this product and to make it worse the cashier was an idiot lost in his own world - What's a combo...dah it's a number 9 with chicken.  OK what's a number 9?"
"1","As a New Yorker, I was looking forward to trying out Chompie's since all my friends have said that I would love it. When I walked in, I could see why - The decor was New York themed, with the Yankees taking up a whole wall in the back and Broadway posters lining the walls by the bathroom. I sat down and looked at the menu, where I saw many familiar offerings.\n\nAfter receiving my food, however, I was disappointed. The Chopped Steak was bland and tasteless. I could not finish it. My friends that ordered other dishes didn't seem to like their meals either. The salad was okay, the fries pretty good. I would not come back for the food.\n\nThe service was lackluster too; waitresses did not refill the water often enough, and my friends soon resorted to sticking ice cubes in their mouth while waiting.\n\nVery disappointed."
"2","I'm pretty surprised by the reviews. We have been here more than a handful of timea for lunch and dinner. Food is fresh and plenty. Service is pleasant. Only drawbacks are long wait times for carry out and dine in. Orange chicken and hot sour soup are delicious!"
"2","Centered between my school, office and house, Copper Star Coffee offers a cozy and versatile environment perfect for doing homework, meeting up with a friend, or simply staring out the window and contemplating life.\nThe variety of hot teas they offer is rather good, as is their hot drip coffee. If you ever get the chance to try their peach blackberry muffin, please do so. It's unlike any muffin I've ever had before.\nThe only downside is parking. They have a parking lot with two spaces plus one handicap space. If you're driving, you're most likely going to have to park on the street or in the neighboring boutique's parking lot (and I don't think they like it when you do that.)"
"2","Love this place!!!   It is so small and dark and quaint!!!  Huge wine selection...and that bruschetta ......Yum!\n\nI didn't really need to add my review because there are so many and most agree that is place is great.\n\nMy favorite thing about Postino is on Mon and Tue nights .....you can buy a bottle of wine and a board of bruschetta for $20 ..plenty for two!\n\nParking can be hard around here...but they offer valet for $3.."
"2","Cows are sexy.  At least they are here at Jean Georges Steakhouse.... And they taste amazing too. The restaurant is dark, sleek and screams high-end without being stuffy. It's the cool kid of steakhouses. They have a great wine display and the music rocks. The food is surprisingly fun and unique for a steak-driven menu and the service was fantastic.\n\nOur feast included:\nTuna Tartare and Rosemary Breadcrumb Crusted Yellowfin Tuna\nCrispy Skin Chicken w/ Lemon Butter\nMiso-Yuzu Glazed Chilean Sea Bass\nBraised Short Rib wi/ Jalepeno Apple Puree\nPrime NY Steak w/ Chimichurri \nBlack Truffle and Comte Cheese Fritter\nBroiled Bone Marrow w/ Parsley-Lemon Gremolata\nWarm Chocolate Cake w/ Vanilla Ice Cream\n\nI felt like I ate the entire universe, but the highlights for me were the tuna, NY steak, fritters and bone marrow.  I think I may have grunted a few times as I ate. Thankfully the music is on the louder side.\n\nI left feeling like a cow... and not a hot one either.  Definitely worth visiting if you appreciate cattle as much as I do."
"2","So, I am rating this place with 4 stars, only because it was my first time going here and I want to go back before I add the extra star.\n\nI am definitely one who is weary of new doctor offices, especially ones that I have never been to before.  I didn't like the last place I went to, so I decided to try somewhere new, and this place is right across the street from my place.  I called, scheduled an appointment (w/o difficulty), and that was that.\n\nThe facility is HUGE.  They have an aesthetic place inside of it.  It seemed like it took me several turns down several halls just to go to my appointment room.  I was greeted by a front office administrator, checked in, and waited.  I scheduled my appointment as early as I could (8:30 am) so that I didn't have to wait long to be seen.\n\nI was called back immediately and greeted by a very friendly back office MA.  She took my vitals, asked several questions, and was off to get the P.A. (Julia).  I was very impressed with the sincere tone of voice and attitude she had.\n\nJulia came right in, smiles and all, and started at it.  I had several concerns to discuss, and she addressed each one with detail and explanation in terms that made sense to me.  I was provided with several samples to use for my condition and was encouraged to come back in 2 weeks for follow-up.\n\nOne reason that I am iffy on new facilities is because I always feel like they try and \""sell\"" you on services.  I got a slight sense of this when I came in.  I wanted to inquire about a full body scan (I have sensitive skin and am at risk of pre-cancerous lesions).  They were adamant about doing it right then and there.  I also had a benign popule under my eyelid, which apparently is considered cosmetic to remove, and they also wanted to have at it in that same visit.  I appreciate them wanting to get it all done, but I didn't have the money up front to throw down for the removal, and wasn't sure how much my insurance would cover for the full body scan.  I opted out this visit to seek this information first.  \n\nIn either case, I definitely recommend this place to anyone.  All of the staff that interacted with was friendly and caring, and concerned about the healing and well being of the patient.\n\nI will provide an updated review when I go back and let you know if they have earned their extra star!  :)"
"1","How long has it been since you tried to get gas somewhere that doesn't have the option to pay at the pump?  \nNot only are they living in the stone age with gas station technology- the line was long, and no wonder. \nWe wanted to fill the tank of our rental car.  We had to guess at the amount. If we guessed too much it meant another wait in line. Too little means we left with a tank not full.  Since you can't take a rental car back like that, we ended up stopping at another gas station to finish the job.\nWhat a waste of time.\nThe clerk was pleasant- but she must get constantly hounded by those who aren't frequent customers.\nOne has to wonder why Chevron allows their name to be muddied by an outlet too cheap to upgrade their technology."
"2","Two words: cookie pizza...  That's all you need to know."
"2","Great selection, nice location with brick walkways, water fountains and plenty of restaurants.  Good for shopping and for photos.  High end stores here mixed with affordable labels too.  Not just clothing, but also gifts, kids things, cigars, and more."
"2","Above and beyond the type of service you'd expect, friendly personel and Zack helped me out of a real bind. Thank you all for your great service and since finding out you are closed on Sundays I want a job! : )"
"1","The worst hospital in the world. We waited two hours in a waiting room suffering with pain, and ended up leaving and going to mercy gilbert who took us right away.  Oh, and the doctors don't know what their talking about . I feel very unsafe at this hospital and would never recommend this to anyone."
"2","I don't know about you all but I think it is so hard to find great sushi and sake at a reasonable price. Especially in Scottsdale! That was until I went to Stingray for Happy Hour. I could not believe the prices. Every roll was only $3 to $5, the food was all under $5, and there was sake for a dollar and a glass of exceptional wine for like $4. You have to try the Gyoza (they are like dumplings). Delicious! This Happy Hour has all the favorites too. The spicy tuna roll, dragon roll (my personal favorite), the shrimp tempura roll, calamari and much much more!\n\nI can't wait to go back!"
"2","Excellent lunch. Special peach/bourbon chicken sandwich and the Harvest salad with shrimp and the Chilled cucumber soup were incredible."
"2","I will never forget Campiti's. As a youngster growing up playing on Potomac Avenue and Dormont. My favorite pizza was and still is Campiti's. I have not found an equal in the 18 years I have been in CA. The hoagies were pretty damn good too."
"2","I had never heard of a third party licensing option, so I was kind of leery when my friend recommended Power Tags, Titles & More. However, the DMV sucks, and this place is right by my house, so I gave it a whirl - and I'm glad I did!\n\nStaff is friendly, prices are fair (a few bucks more than the DMV).\n\nMy vehicle was completely licensed in less than 30 minutes. The process was insanely simple, and I would recommend this place to everyone!\n\nThey don't do drivers licenses as of April 2014 but they said perhaps in the fall."
"1","Don't believe their posted hours. We got there 30 min before closing and we're sent away. Very annoying."
"2","This place is surprisingly cozy and inviting, and the Middle Eastern food is delicious.   It's located in the strip of shops next to the Harris Teeter at Kenilworth Commons so don't miss it when you drive by.  The veggie platter/combo entree is my favorite thing to order- it's huge and it comes with about 8 different items and pita bread.  My boyfriend really likes the pita wraps and the potato harra.  The only negative I have about this place is that it isn't cheap- entrees are mainly $10 or more and the sandwiches are $6, but they don't come with a side.  If you are willing to spend a little bit of money this place is a refreshing change of pace.  Oh, and they have a belly dancer on Friday night."
"2","Love the decor - and it smells fantastic in here! \n\nI ordered the corn & shrimp soup (was a bit disappointed that they didn't have their chili - that's what I REALLY wanted to try) and a chocolate pecan cookie to go. I paid a total of $9.16, which seems really steep for what I got, but I figured that if the food was super yummy, that maybe it would be worth it! \n\nWell.....the soup is really just so-so. In fact, it really tasted like bland corn chowder - the shrimp was incredibly overpowered, and added no flavor whatsoever! I searched our break room for some sort of spice, pepper - ANYTHING, but to no avail! Darn :P Honestly, I wish I had ordered something else - a swing and an epic miss! \n\nOn the up side, it came with four slices of fresh, soft french bread, which was perfect for dipping. The bread gets an A+ from me! (which is great news, because it IS a French bakery, after all...!)\n\nThe cookie never even made it to the end of the meal. That bad boy was finished before I even got to the office. Super, super delish! I might even go back for a few more of these to bring to the office. You should also bring some (for me, that is). \n\nDidn't get any coffee, but I LOVE Peet's coffee, so next time I'm so stopping there for my morning brew. \n\nWill I come here again? Yes. I WILL have that buffalo soup. It shall be mine - oh yes, it shall be mine. \n\nThe staff was friendly, I was greeted kindly as soon as a customer in front of me was finished with their order, but the girl who brought out my food wouldn't look me in the eye. She probably was afraid to lose her soul, so I can understand that. I'd be afraid, too. \n\nTo sum it up, meh - but that doesn't stop me from going back."
"1","This place took my prepaid money of $20 for gas, but instead of getting gas, the pump said \""Waiting for Authorization\"".  I informed the cashier Ana of the problem, but she stated that I got my gas.  I asked her how I could get any gas if the pump was frozen in the \""Waiting for Authorization\"" mode and not a single drop came out.  I asked her to check the pump, but she refused, and refused to refund my money.  She claimed that a seond printout from her cashier said that I was not charged, but when I called my credit card company, it was processed (starting the dispute process for this charge).  The cashier was rude as well as her coworker.  Never felt so mistreated over a purchase in my life."
"1","Never again!  This place was disgusting. I specifically stopped by here to get fresh and healthy food. By was I wrong because there is nothing fresh about this place. We ordered a chicken salad wrap, gyro wrap, falafel wrap, and hummus. All the meats and falafel a were pulled out of a freezer and cooked frozen. Was disgusting. Never going back. How do u advertise a place as fresh food when everything comes from a freezer I can make my own frozen food don't wanna pay for it"
"1","This place was pretty junk. It wasn't so much the decor or the ambience, but rather the staff and the people.  Uh, apparently this place is a restaurant. No clue, I'm talking about the lounge/club.\n\nFirst, it wasn't very busy when we went on a Friday night, and the people who were there looked like they were not having any fun either. They probably got recruited by the various Mandalay Bay properties like the restaurants that promise you free cover if you bring the receipt, or the solicitors on the main floor handing out cards also offering free cover. Well no shit there's free cover, there isn't anybody inside! One of the staff approached us and offered us bottle service for a deal (forget the price) so we accepted, why the hell not it was cheaper than buying at the bar. We had our own little sitting area that was completely empty. This dude acted like he was doing us the biggest favour in the world to be sitting there. He later sends us some girls over who are just looking to get some free drinks from us. They were beautiful, sure, but seriously? I know it's Vegas and everything but come on! We shooed them away and off they went to the only other table in our area with people at it, who were hooting and hollering them over. They chatted with the guys, got their free drinks, then took off making out with various random dudes and getting free drinks along the way. Then off they vanished never to be seen again... The end.\n\nThe patio outside has a really nice view, filled with a lot of not happy looking people as well. Probably felt ripped off because maybe they paid cover? We'll never know."
"2","Great familiy owned middle eastern restaurant.  The food is great, serivce is fantastic, and everyone is very friendly."
"1","I've stayed in some of the worst roach infested seaside motels in California, and this was easily the worst hotel I've ever been in. \n\nIt's Las Vegas, so you really aren't going to spend a ton of time in your room... however, the ability to shower before you go out is sort of a big deal. The shower in our room wouldn't drain and quickly filled up with water. I tried taking a pen and cramming it down the drain to see if I could fix it - I pulled the pen out and a hunk of foul hair and gunk came with it. \n\nThe drain was plugged up with some bitch's entire weave or something... perhaps a dog. We called down to the front desk and were transferred to the wrong department, transferred to a voice mail, and hung up on twice before we were able to get them to send someone out. \n\nThey sent out two maintenance guys to fix it and they spent a half hour blowing air down the drain with a hand pump. This did nothing. They left saying it was still slow, but working a little better. It didn't. All it did was make us late. \n\nIt wasn't just the bathtub malfunction that was a problem... the place was disgusting. There was some sort of small turd near the entry. The vent in the bathroom looked like there was a 1000 year old dead rat inside. The air conditioner sounded like an asthmatic and the busted tile beneath it was covered in dirt. There were all sorts of stains all over the carpet and anything with a surface was covered in layers of old dirt... tops of door frames, mirrors, headboards, etc... \n\nEvery shower curtain ring was broken as well - it felt like some sort of joke - like we were on some sort of reality show... someone just wanted to see us crack.\n\nSadly... the room was 150 per night because we got there on a busy weekend I suppose. Other people online had reported paying in the 30s for their room. I wouldn't have felt right paying 30 any more than I felt right paying 150. I took pictures of everything and brought them downstairs in the morning to the manager who acted relatively nice. I showed her the pictures on my camera and she had me wait to show her head of cleaning staff who looked at them and shrugged at me dismissively.\n\nIn the end, they comped my room. They should've given us tickets to something or gambling money or offered a free night in one of their nicer suites. Had they done anything more than comped the room, I would've tried to be a little more understanding. As it stands though, they did not. \n\nI paid nothing for this room in the end, and it damn near ruined my vacation. It's not worth it at 150, 90, 60, 30 dollars... not even zero. \n\nIf you're a college kid who is happy drinking Bud, your idea of 'ballin' is winning 50 cents in the penny slots, and you are in Vegas to throw televisions through windows and pee in the hallway... you have found your ideal hotel. For a cheap thrill, get in the elevator and ride it as high as it will go - you will fear for your life.\n\nFuck this place."
"1","Beware Spencer's. Horrible customer service. \nWe just had a very bad experience that ended with VISA ruling in our favor to refund our money. \nWe ordered a Vent-a-hood from Spencers to be shipped to our home in California. They shipped it UPS and requested no signature on delivery. It was left at the door because no one was home. When we found it - we noticed the box was very damaged and the hood was dented. We immediately called Spencers and told them we received a damaged hood. Most vendors we have dealt with would simple say \""ship it back and we will replace it\"". Not Spencers - their response was - that's not our problem - if you want a new one we will sell it to you - its your problem\"" I was actually speechless that they would say that. \n\nWe called UPS and they came right out and picked it up. UPS also told us that we can not claim the damage because only the shipper (aka SPENCERS) can claim damage as they contracted and paid for the shipping. This makes perfect sense to almost any average person. Spencers argued with us and said we accepted the damaged shipment so it is our problem. How could we accept a shipment that they (yes SPENCERS) did not require a signature for so it was left at our home when we were not there? As soon as we discovered the damage we called them. \n\nThese guys are just plain bad people. They don't care about you as a customer and apparently they don't care at all about their reputation. We filed a complaint with VISA and they quickly agreed with us that it is SPENCERS FAULT and they were supposed to deliver to us a hood in new condition. They contracted UPS and any damage they have to work with their shipper on. \n\nNeedless to say we were about to purchase a $10,000 range from them which we cancelled - what idiots. \n\nI did further research and found that they received numerous complaints from consumers on after sales support. Yelp, yahoo and even the Better Business Bureau of Phoenix can give you a good idea of what these people are like. \n\nBeware and shop somewhere else."
"1","The restaurant was empty when we went.  It was kind of cool, felt like I reserved the whole restaurant for me and my lady.  \n\nI am giving this place 2 stars because the food was OK.  But the place looks dirty and there was a roach crawling on my seat."
"2","This place hits the spot. My favorite flavor of snoh is either the coconut milk, black sesame, or thai tea. There are so many flavors and toppings to chose from that nearly everyone will find something they like. Also, the boba is pretty descent here. The house milk tea with boba is definitely worth a try."
"2","Studzio is almost more of an art gallery than a restaurant, which is what it aims for in my opinion. It is without a doubt one of the more original and creative restaurants I've been to: the menus are hand-written by a local artist and presented on wood clipboards, the washroom walls are graffitied, instead of plates slabs of slate are used. \n\nThe food itself is good, but not the best. For 42$, we had eggs benedict, an asparagus & bacon omelette, orange & grapefruit juice. All options come with a fruit salad (served in half a coconut), roasted potatoes, some fruit cake, and coffee. \n\nI would definitely come here again based on the decor and ambience alone. Go check it out!"
"2","Vraiment cool comme bar. C'est le m\u00e9lange parfait de la taverne typique (plein de bois, des tables pour s'y asseoir confortablement, des vitraux \u00e0 la \""art d\u00e9co\"", des peanuts au menu) et du bar-lounge moderne.

"1","We're weekly shoppers here and this week was the worst so far! They were out of the Frys 18 pack eggs with no one in the freezer to help. All the the time we're hearing intercom calls for help at the cashiers.  We get ready to check out and they're backed up big times! Another intercom call for help but no one comes. Finally get through only to have Richard the worst bag person I've ever seen. He spent more time looking at his watch than paying attention to how he was bagging our groceries!  I'm hoping they were just having a bad day!!!"
"1","Service: I asked the clerk what would be a good meal for a family of four. He gave his recommendation and I went with it. Got the meal home and we only have 1 mac and cheese, 1 potato salad 5 rolls. Now, this wasn't some big Styrofoam container. It was just enough for one person. The clerk seemed like it was a pain for him to answer some questions about the food that is keeping him employed. \n\nFood: It was ok. Not great, just okay. There wasn't anything that screamed \""Have seconds!\"" The sauce is decent. Nothing spectacular. \n\nOverall, it was a 2 because nothing blew me away. I just made some ribs tonight on the grill and I thought they were better than Honey's. \nIf you're craving bbq, then this will get you out of a pinch. But if you want the \""Slap yo momma\"" type grub, then make an about face."
"2","Typical comedy club with a 2 drink minimum. They pack a full house and put on great shows. I saw Anjelah Johnson and Mal Hall. \n\nWe had reserved seating as we accompanied family members. No seats are really better than others unless you are seated at the foot of the stage.\n\nSimilar to another review I had a server spill steak sauce all over my leg and arm. There was no apology or even recognition of their mistake. I didn't expect anything just disappointed there wasn't any acknowledgment.\n\nAfter the show I had a chance to go back stage for photos, small talk, and good times. The greenroom is quite small about 20x20 is all. \n\nA little tip is to arrive early and enjoy some drinks next door at the bar instead of exceeding your 2 drink minimum. Drink prices are a little over priced but the appetizers are worth the money! Got to try the Nachos!\n\nGreat times, enjoy the show!"
"1","Don't even waste your time, food quality poor, we had high hopes for this place but what a disappointment.  We took one bite and headed for the trash!  Pei Wei blows this place away.  The only good feedback I can give is the restaurant was clean..."
"2","One of the BEST buffets I've been to in a long time.  \n\nThe macaroni and cheese station did it for me.  Not your box Kraft Mac n Cheese but real deal Cheesy Gooey Goodness!!!  Out of the meat add ins I chose to add shrimp. Mmm Mmm\n\nSome of the servings came served in small dishes which keeps the portion size under control as well as the germs from those handles being touched by hundreds or finger licked hands. Ugh!! \n(Sorry, I'm a bit of a germaphobe)\n\nThe service was impeccable.  Everyone that worked there who passed our table whether they were serving our table or not spoke and made sure we were ok.  \n\nThe water craft on the table I thought was a good idea giving me the impression that my water was filtered and sometimes room temperature water taste better then ice cold.\n\nThe only thing I probably would have liked to see was an open bar, but all in all a great buffet and a wonderful experience."
"1","Service was prompt and friendly. Unfortunately the food was barely mediocre. I had the clams in white wine and garlic sauce and although the sauce was palatable, the clams were chewy and tasteless. We also had the spaghetti with meat sauce, which was very typical and hamburger-y. Definitely feel like we could have had much better Italian food in the area for the same price. Shame."
"1","I am not impressed. The pizza, garlic knots, meatballs zeppole were decent, but nothing to write home about. \n\nThe worst part was the spaghetti and meatballs dinner I ordered. I asked for sauce on the side, which they did. But they gave me a minuscule portion of spaghetti (not even enough for a child's portion IMO and it was hard and had obviously been sitting. There was literally more sauce than pasta. \n\nThe side salad with grilled chicken is $3 more than without, so I assumed they must give a decent sized piece of chicken with it. You know what they say when you assume, right? There was maybe half a cutlet's worth or pre-frozen, microwave grilled chicken (think McDonald's kind) on it. \n\nSo all in all, I paid almost $20 ($12 for the spaghetti and $7 for the salad) for what amounts to a child's portion of food (half of which was inedible). We got the food maybe 30 minutes before closing, so when I called to let them know I figured we could just work it out next time (we were happy with everything else) but the phone just rang and rang. We will definitely go somewhere else next time."
"1","Pizza is so-so, good hang out place just next door. Weird service.\n\nWent there today, had pear and walnut salad, that was good! The Lime Chicken sandwich was ok."
"2","I've been to La Bocca a handful of times now, mostly because its one of the few \""nicer\"" options on Mill.  Because of that it is getting a 4th star but the food and drink only warrant 3. \n\nLets just call La Bocca what it is...it's  a starter wine bar for college kids. The wine list is less than impressive and anyone that actually enjoys drinking wine wouldn't settle for a wine bar with a wine list that is dominated by wine from California. Yes, names like \""Little Black Dress\"" are cute but this isn't a quality selection. But the kiddies have got to start somewhere when they are learning about wine and that is the purpose of La Bocca. \n\nAs far as the food goes...well... the Mediterranean salad is good. Get that. I can't say that I would suggest the bruschetta. The flavors are lacking in creativity and they are often poorly constructed. The pizza is ok, but like I said, stick to that salad. \n\nShould you find yourself on Mill you could do much, much worse. If you are looking for a wine bar in the vein of Postino, Cheuvront, or Tapino, think again. You are on Mill after all."
"1","My wife loves the Market Tea room (or shoudl i say loved). We have gone about once or twice a month for about the last 6 months. We will not go back. There is a waitress who is beyond miserable (. It is such a shame...If you read this review and still decide to go, you have been warned. She will ruin the entire experience. I say it is a shame beacuse the owner is sweet and the food is good."
"1","Underwhelming.\n\nThe M is a sleek place and everything is so beautifully done.  All of their eateries are so promising, but unfortunately always fail to deliver.  The layout and design of Terzetto is gorgeous and looks like something you'd find further North on the Strip.  Their menu is not uber creative, but it has the steakhouse staples.  \n\nI went with a party of seven and the service was fantastic.  Our server was timely, attentive and helpful (granted, the place wasn't exactly packed).  The service was the best part of the night.\n\nThe food, however, was merely underwhelming.  The steaks were cooked appropriately, but lacked any real beef flavor and the all-important char.  Sure, I'm not paying $50+ for a bone-in rib eye (like at Prime or Carnevino), but in order to compete in this economy and market, it should still taste as good.  The sides were good, but not very memorable.\n\nTerzetto is a value, in that prices are below what you'd find at the better steakhouses.  Unfortunately, you get what you pay for and this place is underwhelming."
"2","Checked in online and was in and out in under half an hour. Location was clean and my stylist, Tasha, was great. Conversational and adept at what she does - she knew exactly what I was looking for and completed it efficiently."
"1","We arrived here yesterday. The rooms are very nice, but the beds are awful!!!! We took 3 separate rooms and all of them had the same problem. It seems like these mattresses had been used forever.... Also, the doors are so heavy that we are constantly concern about our kids fingers; even for an adult its hard to open them. I would not recommend this hotel. Never coming back... We looked for a nice hotel w out cigaret smoke and casino, but this experience is not worth it...."
"2","I first found Vince's on an emergency situation. Note to all readers don't let your inspection and emissions lapse near a cop. I called as soon as they opened and they had me in that very day. They were also more than accommodating in the fact that my paperwork wasn't all in order but since I was able to prove that insurance and registration were current they were able to finagle some magic within the system to get me cleared and through. The check itself was done quickly and thoroughly to boot. When I was told I needed an new part to pass the inspection (exterior mirror, damn hooligans with bats) they told me they would pass me if I paid parts and labor that day as the new mirror needed to be ordered. I completely understand this. If you are going to put your reputation and possibly your state license on the line you need a guarantee I am coming back. What really shocked me was the bill. Emissions, inspection, parts and labor all came to... a hair over $200. I almost felt like I was robbing THEM! When the part was in they called me to inform me promptly and when I was finally able to get my car in the fix was done before I could get back from the quick stop a block away for my daily caffeine fix. Customer service is top of the mark here. These guys do it right. The only thing that might put a visitor off is the fact that since these are hard working guys who work in a primarily open air/open door garage they do smoke. I don't mind because that is one of my own personal vices (sorry mom) but a non smoker might be put off. I say forget the second hand stuff and go anyway cause these guys are tops at providing great work and some of the best customer service I have ever had at a mechanics place. 5 stars all the way."
"1","I was very disappointed with the service or lack there of from benefit air. \n\nMy A.C. unit wasn't working properly so I called Benefit heating and air. I was charged a $79 service for the tech to come out which seems to be standard with most of the companies. From the moment Chuck the tech came out he was only concerned with selling me a new unit. He spent almost all of his time taking measurements and giving me a quote on a $9000 new unit. When he finished I asked him if he repaired or replaced anything and he said no. When it was all said and done I paid $79 for a quote on a new unit. \n\nIN MY OPINION THEY SENT OUT A SALESMAN NOT A TECH.\n\nAfter he left I called around for a second opinion. I found a company that didn't charge a service fee for coming out. The new tech arrived, determined the problem within 10 minutes and asked if I wanted it repaired for $149.00. What would you have done? $9000 or $149? That was a no brainer for me. \n\nBenefit heating and air was NO BENEFIT to me.\n\n( In response to Michaels reply )\n\nI did contact Michael who apologized for my negative experience and offered and sent out a refund of my $79.  \n\nThanks again Michael"
"2","Beautiful dining room hidden in Old Town Scottsdale.  We made a reservation and scored an outdoor table on a lovely May evening.  It was the perfect night to sit outside and enjoy an amazing meal.  My husband and I shared the grilled octopus to start - fresh, flavorful and inventive.  I tried the duck for my entree and it was perfectly prepared...a little sweet with the cherry demi and a little savory with the mushrooms and kale.  This place is a must stop on your culinary tour of the Valley."
"1","Beautiful atmosphere and that's about it! Reservation was at 8pm. First round of drinks took 40 minutes and the place was dead! My girlfriend already did a Yelp Review on this place and I am pretty sure she covered everything! I am mostly dissapointed that a manager never came to the table to apologize or acknowledge all the issues we had that night. Super pricey for a super let down! We thought that with Eva Longoria's name behind this restaurant, it would have been amazing, but it was far from it! :( N wonder we were able to get reservations so easily!"
"1","I feel bad 'cause I know this is a local owned business, it's close to me and I believe has been here since I moved here in '94. Used to be the only store and I never had a problem with it. The employees are great!  Not sure if more selection has raised my awareness or if this place has just degraded in what it offers.\n\nPrices vary - all the markets play their games, price this low to get people in, mark other things up to make the profit. But the selection of fresh produce is lacking and the meat is really mediocre. I have shopped AJ's and it appears Eddie Basha is sending all the good stuff there and placing the leftovers here. Never a great selection, overpriced and I have been really disappointed with the beef I've gotten here.\n\nHope they can stay in business but I actually drive a bit out of my way to hit the Fry's as they have a better selection of produce and meat. Not great but better for sure. I go here now only if I'm in dire need of some staple item and am too lazy to drive the extra few miles."
"1","So this is the second time I come and the doors are locked. It seems like no one is in there. The website says they open at 10:30 I think. It's about to be 2 pm and they are closed. Managment should keep up with hours of operation if they changed. Is it even open for business if not please update your website"
"2","Came here as a party of 4 on Christmas Eve - we had a reservation, but the place was jammed packed so I was unsure of the wait, despite having a reservation. We checked in and were taken immediately to a table. Our server was excellent, we never had an empty class. The food was wonderful, not a long wait for it to come out and just an overall great experience. 5 stars for excellent customer service and tasty food!"
"1","idk...i've gotta say, i've had far better pizza than this.  i too was excited to try this place based on the reviews.  we got decent service, in fact our server was super nice and cute.  we split a salad that was simply lettuce and spinach with a tomato thrown in. the 5 bucks we spent on that could have purchased both 1 bag of lettuce and 1 bag of spinach.\n\nmy first glass of wine was corked and so much so that when i went to take a drink it burned my eyes but they were very nice about getting me a new glass of wine.\n\nnow on to the pie...  \n\nwe got the spinach special which came with a saccharin sweet sauce; personal preference would be a bit tangier but it was the grease and the crust that was the bummer.  when i get thin crust i like it to be crisp but this? not so much.  mush to the sogg town. \n\ncan't say that we will come back, there are just too many good pizza places in town."
